# Session with Codex - September 23, 2025

## Summary of Uncommitted Changes

### Backend
- Introduced reusable admin guard and impersonation-ready routes across admin-related domains, including new provisioning, assignment, and directory endpoints. Key files: pps/backend/server/domains/adminUsers/guards.ts, pps/backend/server/domains/{assignments,directory,provisioning}/routes.fastify.ts, and supporting stores/validators.
- Expanded identity utilities to generate prefixed IDs, normalise identities, and expose helper exports for downstream consumers (pps/backend/server/domains/identity/*).
- Updated server bootstrap to surface first-name metadata and register the new domain modules while retaining legacy functionality (pps/backend/server/index.ts).
- Adjusted TypeScript configuration to target ESNext module output for the backend build (pps/backend/tsconfig.json).

### Frontend
- Overhauled Admin Hub directory tables and interaction flows to fetch live data via SWR hooks and navigate into impersonated hubs when clicking IDs (pps/frontend/src/hubs/AdminHub.tsx and new child components under pps/frontend/src/hubs/components/).
- Added Admin Create/Assign UI components wired to the new API clients (pps/frontend/src/hubs/components/Admin{Create,Assign}Section.tsx).
- Introduced shared API clients for admin, assignments, directory, and provisioning calls (pps/frontend/src/shared/api/*).
- Enhanced App.tsx routing with /[:subject]/hub impersonation support, automatic impersonation clearing on /hub, and supporting helpers (pps/frontend/src/App.tsx).
- Updated MyHubSection wrapper to pull role/code/name directly from the auth hook so greetings and user IDs reflect impersonated context (pps/frontend/src/components/MyHubSection.tsx).
- Revised logout hook to clear impersonation session data (pps/frontend/src/hooks/useLogout.ts).
- Adjusted tsconfig path aliases for newly shared packages (pps/frontend/tsconfig.json, pps/test-interface/tsconfig.json).

### Auth Package (@cks/auth)
- Augmented useAuth with impersonation awareness, richer bootstrap data (full name, first name, owner first name), and resilience against StrictMode double renders; it now exposes an impersonating flag and respects impersonated URLs (uth/src/hooks/useAuth.ts).
- Added a central impersonation utility with helpers to normalise IDs, infer roles, and manage session storage; exported from the package entrypoint (uth/src/utils/impersonation.ts, uth/src/index.ts).

### Packages / Shared UI
- Simplified admin widgets (Archive/Assign sections) to remove placeholder mock content and align with new Admin Hub flows (packages/domain-widgets/src/admin/*).
- Updated MyHubSection component variants and stories to accept welcome names and reflect impersonated states (packages/ui/src/navigation/MyHubSection/*).

### Documentation
- Expanded Custom ID and data reference documentation; added the current working session log (docs/CustomIdSystem.md, docs/DataFieldsReference.md, SESSION WITH CODEX - 2025-09-22.md) and removed obsolete field-mapping doc.

## Next Steps
1. Remove remaining mock data from the newly created Manager Hub and wire it to live API responses.
2. Continue building new users end-to-end through the Admin Hub create flows, verifying provisioning/assignment updates.
3. Exercise full app functionality (all hubs, directory tabs, impersonation paths) to confirm the new impersonation and data-loading logic behaves correctly.
