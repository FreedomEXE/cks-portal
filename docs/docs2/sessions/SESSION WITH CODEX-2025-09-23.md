# Session with Codex - 2025-09-23

## Summary of progress
- Investigated why the manager hub lost its "Browse CKS Catalog" action and tab descriptions in My Services.
- Traced the regression to the in-progress ManagerHub refactor that dropped the TabSection `description` and `actionButton` props.
- Restored the Button import plus the catalog CTA and contextual copy so the manager view matches the other hubs again.
- Verified that other hubs (Customer, Center, Contractor, Crew, Warehouse) retained their catalog buttons and descriptions.

## Current state
- Manager hub My Services tabs now render their descriptions and the "Browse CKS Catalog" button.
- The button still logs to the console pending integration with the real catalog flow.
- Repository remains ahead of `origin/main` with the broader ManagerHub rewrite and related shared UI updates in progress.

## Next steps
1. Smoke-test the manager hub in the browser to confirm the restored UI behaves as expected.
2. Wire the catalog action to the intended navigation once the catalog experience is ready.
3. Continue reviewing the ManagerHub refactor for any additional regressions before committing.
