# Session with Codex - September 22, 2025

**Date:** September 22, 2025  
**Assistant:** Codex (GPT-5)  
**Project:** CKS Portal  
**Scope:** AdminHub data cleanup + ID formatting alignment

---

## What We Completed Today

### 1. Admin Hub Data Cleanup
- Replaced the old mock-filled `AssignSection` and `ArchiveSection` components in `@cks/domain-widgets` with versions that keep the tab structure but surface empty tables (mirrors the Directory experience when no data exists).
- Rebuilt the `domain-widgets` package so the Admin Hub now consumes the new empty-table components.

### 2. Backend Directory API Normalization
- Added `formatPrefixedId` helper in `apps/backend/server/domains/directory/store.ts` to ensure all IDs returned from the directory endpoints use the canonical `PREFIX-XXX` style (e.g., `SRV-001`, `PRD-001`, `WHS-001`).
- Updated loaders for managers, contractors, customers, centers, crew, warehouses, services, products, training, and orders to use the helper.
- Regenerated the directory output so services/managers in the Admin Hub reflect live data with the correct ID format.

### 3. Database Reset for Non-Admin Tabs
- Cleared existing seed/sample rows from Render PostgreSQL tables (`services`, `managers`, `contractors`, `customers`, `centers`, `crew`, `products`, `training`, `procedures`, `reports`, `feedback`, `orders`, `system_activity`) to give the Admin Hub a clean slate. Only the Admin tab now displays real data.

### 4. Shared API Client Fix
- Created `apps/frontend/src/shared/api/client.ts` and patched the regex bug so it exports cleanly and handles auth token injection shared across AdminHub APIs.

### 5. Frontend Directory Integration Touch-ups
- `AdminHub.tsx` now builds its directory config from actual API hooks, surfaces per-tab loading/error messages, and ensures empty states read correctly.
- Removed dangling mock arrays and unused types from the hub component.

## Outstanding Items Before Implementing the Create Flow

1. **Doc Touch-Up (Optional but Recommended)**
   - Add short notes to `docs/CustomIdSystem.md` covering the sequential ID generation strategy and soft-delete/unassigned behaviour (captured during today’s discussion but not yet documented).

2. **Backend Sequences Check**
   - Confirm Postgres sequences exist for managers, contractors, etc., and expose helper functions to generate the next formatted ID when we build the create endpoints.

3. **Admin API Surface for Creation**
   - Define/verify the backend routes for creating managers/contractors/customers, including validation schemas and the ID assignment logic.

4. **Frontend CreateSection Audit**
   - Review the existing `CreateSection` component (currently still using placeholder UI + mock states) to scope the required form fields and API wiring.

5. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Plan basic integration tests for the new directory endpoints and the upcoming create flows (e.g., seed -> create -> fetch -> assert ID format).

## Next Focus

**Implement and test the Create tab so administrators can provision new users/entities with the live ID system.**

This will include hooking up the create forms to the backend, ensuring IDs are generated via the new sequence logic, and confirming the directory tabs update in real time without manual refreshes.
