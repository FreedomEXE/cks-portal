# Session Notes — SESSION WITH CODEX - 2025-09-25

## Changes Since Last Commit
- Added migration database/migrations/20250925130000_add_clerk_user_ids_to_roles.sql to introduce nullable clerk_user_id columns and partial unique indexes across hub tables (managers, contractors, customers, centers, crew, warehouses).
- Implemented shared identity lookup helpers and re-exports so hub accounts can be resolved by Clerk ID or CKS code without relying on dmin_users.
- Overhauled the auth guard to support dev overrides, preserve admin impersonation, and consistently return enriched account metadata.
- Refactored identity impersonation route to reuse repository logic and streamline display-name handling.
- Tightened the frontend dev-auth helper so admin APIs bypass overrides; added a console helper for quick role/code switching.
- Added scripts/list-users.ts for ts-node friendly inspection of current admin/hub records.

## New / Updated Functionality
- Real hub users can now authenticate through Clerk-based IDs while admins continue to impersonate via the same resolution path.
- Dev-mode overrides no longer interfere with admin endpoints; window.__cksDevAuth({...}) simplifies toggling roles during local testing.
- Admin impersonation respects target status while skipping status blocks for the acting admin.

## Code Summary
- pps/backend/server/domains/identity/repository.ts: role table configs, normalized account mapping, new getHubAccountByClerkId/getHubAccountByCode helpers.
- pps/backend/server/core/auth/guards.ts: GuardAccount shape, dev-header logic, impersonation flow, admin status bypass, and consistent guard return type.
- pps/backend/server/domains/identity/impersonation.routes.ts: consolidated account lookup via repository helpers.
- pps/backend/server/domains/identity/service.ts: re-exported helpers/types for broader consumption.
- pps/frontend/src/shared/api/client.ts: conditional dev headers, console auth helper, retained impersonation header support.
- database/migrations/20250925130000_add_clerk_user_ids_to_roles.sql & scripts/list-users.ts: schema expansion and developer tooling.

## Other Notes
- Migration confirmed against the Render-hosted database (hostname requires regional suffix).
- Sample relationships (manager/contractor/customer/center/crew/warehouse) verified; dashboards await seeded orders/products/deliveries for real metrics.
- pnpm lint passes; next up is seeding data and wiring role-based capability checks per hub feature.
