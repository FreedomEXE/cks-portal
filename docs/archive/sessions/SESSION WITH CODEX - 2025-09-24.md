# Session Summary - Codex (2025-09-24)

## Changes Since Last Commit
- Added shared role guard (`requireActiveRole`) and refactored admin guard to consume it (`apps/backend/server/core/auth/guards.ts`, `apps/backend/server/domains/adminUsers/guards.ts`).
- Implemented customer hub backend surfaces: profile, dashboard, and orders routes plus supporting stores/types (`apps/backend/server/domains/{profile,dashboard,orders}/store.ts`, `routes.fastify.ts`, `types.ts`).
- Registered new hub routes in Fastify bootstrap and corrected CORS callback to satisfy TypeScript (`apps/backend/server/index.ts`).
- Created frontend hub data client (`apps/frontend/src/shared/api/hub.ts`) exposing `useHubProfile`, `useHubDashboard`, and `useHubOrders`.
- Rewired `CustomerHub` to use live data hooks, removing mock data and adding derived status/UX states (`apps/frontend/src/hubs/CustomerHub.tsx`).
- Updated `.gitignore` to suppress Windows `nul` artifact.
- Extended hub profile store/service to hydrate manager, contractor, center, crew, and warehouse roles with shared contact metadata (`apps/backend/server/domains/profile/{store,types}.ts`).
- Expanded frontend hub profile response typing to surface the new contact references (`apps/frontend/src/shared/api/hub.ts`).

## New Functionality
- Customer hub now displays real profile, dashboard metrics, ecosystem scaffolding, services, orders, and activity feeds pulled from backend APIs.
- Backend exposes `/api/hub/profile/:cksCode`, `/api/hub/dashboard/:cksCode`, and `/api/hub/orders/:cksCode` endpoints guarded per-user by `requireActiveRole`.
- Hub profile endpoint now returns fully populated payloads for manager, contractor, center, crew, and warehouse accounts.

## Code Highlights
- Backend domain layers compose existing directory data into role-specific payloads, keeping customer logic isolated for iterative expansion to other roles.
- Frontend status rendering now normalizes labels, applies palette-based badges, and surfaces loading/error states for profile, dashboard, and order data.
- Hooks share the same SWR/authed-fetch utility, yielding consistent caching and error handling across hub views.
- Multi-role profile loader stitches related manager/contractor/customer/center contacts so downstream hubs can present a richer relationship graph.

## Verification
- `pnpm --filter @cks/backend build`
- `pnpm --filter @cks/frontend build`

## Next Considerations
- Extend the multi-role pattern to hub dashboard and orders stores/routes so every persona gets live metrics and order views.
- Wire non-customer hub components to the shared `useHubProfile` hook and normalize their UI states around the expanded payload shape.
- Add Fastify route tests plus React hook/unit coverage to lock in role-based access and data mapping.
- Define a shared schema contract (e.g., zod or OpenAPI) for hub payloads to keep frontend and backend in sync as additional fields land.
