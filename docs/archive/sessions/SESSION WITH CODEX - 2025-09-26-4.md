# Session Summary - 2025-09-26 (Morning)

## Changes Since Last Commit
- Manager hub now pulls profile data via `useHubProfile`, eliminating the admin-only directory dependency that was returning empty results for managers.
- Profile card data shaping updated to merge `/api/hub/profile` metadata (territory, reportsTo, createdAt) with any legacy directory fields.

## New / Adjusted Behaviour
- Manager profile screen populates address, phone, email, territory, reports-to, and start date for provisioned managers (e.g., MGR-011) without requiring admin privileges.
- Account status in the overview cards respects the hub profile payload when available.

## Code Touchpoints
- `apps/frontend/src/hubs/ManagerHub.tsx`: import `useHubProfile`, feed hub profile into display name/root ID, recompute overview stats using role-safe data, and rebuild `managerProfileData` to surface metadata values.

## Tests
- `pnpm --filter ./apps/frontend build`

## Notes / Follow-up
- Remaining manager hub sections (orders, ecosystem, services) still lean on `/admin/directory/*`; migrate them to role-scoped endpoints to avoid 403s for non-admin sessions.
- Documentation gaps spotted in `docs/ClerkIntegration.md` and `docs/Authentication.md` (currently placeholders); update them with the latest Clerk metadata usage, bootstrap flow, and hub profile endpoints. Consider starting an `API_Surface.md` refresh once the new hub endpoints settle.
