# Session with Claude - 2025-09-26-3

## Session Overview
**Date**: September 26, 2025
**Agent**: Claude (Anthropic)
**Focus Areas**: System design documentation creation, mock data removal, and architectural planning

## Changes Made Since Last Commit

### 1. Mock Support Ticket Data Removal
- **File Modified**: `packages/domain-widgets/src/support/SupportSection.tsx`
- **Change**: Removed hardcoded mock tickets (TKT-001, TKT-002) and replaced with empty array
- **Line 209**: Changed from mock ticket array to `const myTickets: SupportTicket[] = [];`
- **Build Process**: Rebuilt domain-widgets package to ensure changes propagated to dist folder
- **Impact**: Users no longer see fake support tickets in their Support tab

### 2. Comprehensive Design Documentation Created

Created four major system design documents in the `docs/` folder:

#### A. Support Ticket System (`SUPPORT_TICKET_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`)
- Complete end-to-end support ticket system design
- Database schema for tickets, messages, and history
- Real-time WebSocket updates
- Role-based access control
- Satisfaction ratings and feedback collection
- 4-phase implementation plan

#### B. Order System (`ORDER_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`)
- Comprehensive order management with catalog integration
- Dual system for Product and Service orders
- Complex approval workflows based on role hierarchy
- ViewerStatus concept for persona-specific status display
- Shopping cart persistence
- Complete catalog system design with products and services tables
- Role-based approval chains

#### C. Services View System (`SERVICES_VIEW_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`)
- **Revised from initial complex design to simpler view-only system**
- Read-only service data displays varying by role
- Manager certification tracking
- No complex workflows - services are created automatically from approved orders
- Role-specific views:
  - Managers: Services they're certified in/can train
  - Crew: Active and historical services
  - Customers/Contractors: Their service relationships

#### D. Reports & Feedback System (`REPORTS_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`)
- Dual system for Reports (serious issues) vs Feedback (general communication)
- Hierarchy-based reporting permissions
- **Key Update**: Crew can create reports that are only visible to their manager
- Complete audit trail with status history
- Manager system-wide resolution authority
- ID generation system (RPT-XXX, FDB-XXX)

## New Features Added

### Documentation Features
1. **Detailed Database Schemas** - All documents include complete SQL table definitions with indexes
2. **API Endpoint Specifications** - RESTful API routes defined for each system
3. **TypeScript Interfaces** - Full type definitions for backend services
4. **React Component Examples** - Frontend implementation samples
5. **User Flow Diagrams** - Step-by-step workflows with edge cases
6. **Testing Strategies** - Unit, integration, and E2E test examples
7. **Security Considerations** - Role-based access control matrices
8. **Performance Optimizations** - Caching strategies, indexes, and query optimizations

## Code Changes Summary

### Files Modified
1. `packages/domain-widgets/src/support/SupportSection.tsx` - Removed mock data
2. `packages/domain-widgets/dist/` - Rebuilt to reflect source changes

### Files Created
1. `docs/SUPPORT_TICKET_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md` - 650+ lines
2. `docs/ORDER_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md` - 1400+ lines
3. `docs/SERVICES_VIEW_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md` - 500+ lines
4. `docs/REPORTS_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md` - 900+ lines

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Services Simplification
- Initially designed complex service execution system with crew assignment workflows
- Revised to simple view-only system after understanding actual requirements
- Services are created automatically from approved orders, no manual creation

### 2. Reports System Update
- Original spec had crew as view-only for reports
- Updated based on partner meeting: Crew CAN create reports
- Added special handling: Crew reports only visible to their direct manager
- Added `crew_manager_id` field to route crew reports appropriately

### 3. Order System Complexity
- Designed comprehensive approval chain system
- Different workflows based on originating role
- ViewerStatus concept to show "pending" (yellow) when action needed
- Catalog integration for real product/service selection

## Design Principles Applied

1. **Role-Based Access Control** - Every system has detailed permission matrices
2. **Audit Trails** - Complete history tracking for compliance
3. **Scalability** - Proper indexing, caching, and query optimization strategies
4. **Phased Implementation** - Each system has 4-week implementation plan
5. **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript definitions throughout
6. **Real-time Updates** - WebSocket events defined where appropriate

## Next Steps & Recommendations

### Immediate Priority
1. **My Ecosystem Design** - Last remaining major system to document
2. **Implementation Phase 1** - Start with Support Tickets (simplest system)
3. **Database Migrations** - Create migration files from design schemas

### Questions to Resolve
1. **Pricing Model** - How are prices calculated for orders?
2. **Inventory Integration** - Real-time stock tracking approach?
3. **Notification System** - Email vs SMS vs push notifications?
4. **Recurring Services** - Built into services or separate system?
5. **Payment Processing** - When/how integrated with orders?

### Technical Debt Addressed
- Removed all hardcoded mock data from Support section
- Documented existing implicit business rules
- Clarified role hierarchies and permissions

## Session Notes

### Important Context
- The CKS system has complex role-based hierarchies
- Reports flow upward through the organization
- Orders require multi-step approvals
- Services are derived from orders, not created independently
- Crew members have special visibility rules for reports

### Design Evolution
- Started with assumptions about service complexity
- Adjusted based on actual codebase inspection
- Incorporated partner feedback about crew reporting capabilities
- Balanced between comprehensive features and practical implementation

### Files Referenced During Session
- `docs/docs2/workflows/CKS ORDER WORKFLOW.md`
- `docs/docs2/ui-flows/CKS Reports UI Flow and Descriptors.md`
- Various hub components (ManagerHub, CrewHub, CustomerHub, etc.)
- Support components (SupportSection, AdminSupportSection)

## Summary

This session focused on creating comprehensive design documentation for the core CKS portal systems. Four major design documents were created covering Support Tickets, Orders, Services Views, and Reports/Feedback systems. Mock data was successfully removed from the Support section. The designs follow consistent patterns with role-based access control, audit trails, and phased implementation plans. All documents are ready to be used as implementation guides for the development team.

**Total Documentation Created**: ~3,500+ lines of detailed system design
**Key Achievement**: Complete architectural blueprint for core CKS functionality
**Ready for**: Implementation Phase 1 starting with Support Ticket system
