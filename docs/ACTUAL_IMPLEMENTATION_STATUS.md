---

### 4. Reports & Feedback System (100%)

Complete structured reporting system with:

#### Components
- ✅ **ReportsSection** - Tabbed interface (Reports / Feedback)
- ✅ **ReportCard** - Individual report display with actions
- ✅ **ReportDetailsModal** - Full report view

#### Features
- ✅ Structured creation with categories (Service / Order / Procedure)

**Status:** Production-ready, fully integrated in all hubs

---

### 5. Activity Feed System (95%)

Complete activity feed implementation across all 7 hubs:

#### Components
- ✅ **ActivityFeed** - Displays recent activities with role-based filtering
- ✅ **ActivityItem** - Individual activity card (clickable)
- ✅ **ActivityModalGateway** - Smart router to correct modal
- ✅ **useFormattedActivities** - Hook for formatting activity data

#### Routing Logic
- ✅ **activityRouter.ts** - Routes activities to correct modals for non-admin roles
- ✅ **adminActivityRouter.ts** - Admin-specific routing (archive tab navigation)
- ✅ **activityHelpers.ts** - Parsing, formatting, metadata extraction

#### Smart Routing Examples
```
Order Created → ProductOrderModal / ServiceOrderModal
User Assigned → UserModal
Service Started → ServiceViewModal
Report Submitted → ReportDetailsModal
Archive Event → Navigate to Archive tab + open entity modal
```

#### Backend
- ✅ **activity/writer.ts** - Activity creation with RBAC scope filtering
- ✅ Proper actor/target/metadata tracking
- ✅ Scope-aware queries (users only see activities they're allowed to see)

**Integration:** All 7 hubs display activity feeds on dashboard

---

### 6. Hub Architecture Modernization (90%)

All 7 hubs refactored with consistent patterns:

#### Row-Click Pattern (Replacing Actions Column)
**Old:** Tables had "ACTIONS" column with buttons
**New:** Click entire row to open modal

```typescript
// Before
{ key: 'actions', label: 'ACTIONS', render: renderActions }

// After
onRowClick={(row) => {
  setSelectedOrderId(row.id);
}}
```

**Status:**
- ✅ AdminHub: 10+ tables updated (directory, orders, services, archive)
- ✅ ManagerHub: All tables updated
- ✅ ContractorHub: All tables updated
- ✅ CustomerHub: All tables updated
- ✅ CenterHub: All tables updated
- ✅ CrewHub: All tables updated
- ✅ WarehouseHub: All tables updated

#### Order Details Hook
- ✅ **useOrderDetails** - Centralized order fetching with enrichment
- ✅ Handles both product and service orders
- ✅ Enriches with profile data (managed_by, created_by, etc.)
- ✅ Extracts archive/delete metadata
- ✅ Integrated in OrderDetailsGateway component

#### Archive Section Enhancements
- ✅ **ArchiveSection** - Smart row-click routing
  - Orders → OrderDetailsModal directly
  - Services → ServiceModal directly (via `onViewServiceDetails`)
  - Other entities → ActionModal (fallback)
- ✅ Removed "View" button column
- ✅ Clean, clickable table interface

---

### 7. Backend Enhancements (100%)

## 🎯 What Changed vs. Original Plans

### VIEW_MODALS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (OBSOLETE)

**Plan Said:**
- Create ProductCatalogModal, ServiceCatalogModal, ServiceHistoryModal (3 separate modals)
- Wire them up to hubs manually
- Timeline: 3-5 days

**Reality:**
- ✅ Created **ProductModal** (handles catalog + inventory)
- ✅ Created **ServiceModal** (handles catalog + active + history in one modal with tabs)
- ✅ All hubs already wired with onRowClick handlers
- ✅ Went beyond plan: Added Reports system, Activity system, Cards, Banners

**Result:** Plan completed and exceeded in scope

---

## 🔧 Technical Patterns Established

### 1. Modal Architecture Pattern
```typescript
// Reusable base with tabs
<BaseViewModal
  isOpen={isOpen}
  onClose={onClose}
  card={<EntityCard variant="embedded" tabs={...} />}
  tabs={tabs}
  activeTab={activeTab}
  onTabChange={setActiveTab}
>
  {/* Tab content */}
</BaseViewModal>
```

### 2. Row-Click Pattern
```typescript
// No more action columns
<DataTable
  columns={[...]}  // No 'actions' column
  data={rows}
  onRowClick={(row) => setSelectedEntity(row)}
/>
```

### 3. Activity Routing Pattern
```typescript
// Smart routing based on activity type
const handleActivityClick = (activity) => {
  const route = activityRouter(activity, role);
  route.action(); // Opens correct modal
};
```

### 4. Order Enrichment Pattern
```typescript
// Centralized order fetching with enrichment
const { order, loading } = useOrderDetails(orderId);
// order includes: managed_by profile, created_by profile, archive metadata
```
