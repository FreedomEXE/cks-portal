# CURRENT SESSION 2025-08-29

Focus: Orders implementation, Create tab redesign, crew creation fixes, crew assignment workflow, and database cleanup.

## Highlights

- **Orders Integration**
  - Completed Orders list endpoint in Admin backend with proper field mapping from database schema
  - Wired Orders tab in Admin Directory with search and pagination support
  - Orders now show: order_id, type (Service/Product), requester (customer), status, and date

- **Create Tab Redesign**
  - Converted Create tab from scattered boxes to organized tabbed interface
  - 5 clean tabs: Users, Services, Procedures, Training, Catalog
  - Updated header to simply "Create" and removed verbose description
  - Improved scalability for adding future creation options

- **Crew Creation Fixes**
  - Resolved "Invalid Role" error by fixing backend database column mapping
  - Updated crew creation query to match actual database schema: `crew(crew_id, name, status, role, address, phone, email, assigned_center)`
  - Crew creation now works properly with profile data stored in JSONB field

- **Crew Assignment Workflow**
  - Implemented Crew→Center assignment with readiness soft-gate in Admin Assign tab
  - Added readiness scoring based on training and procedure requirements
  - Admin override functionality for assignment without full readiness
  - Backend endpoints: `/crew/unassigned`, `/crew/:id/requirements`, `/crew/:id/assign-center`

- **Database Cleanup**
  - Created comprehensive cleanup script for removing all demo/seed data
  - Successfully cleaned 168 demo records across all entity and operational tables
  - Proper ordering to handle foreign key constraints
  - Fresh database ready for user testing

## Backend API Updates

- **Orders**: `GET /api/admin/orders` with field mapping and search support
- **Crew Assignment**: 
  - `GET /api/admin/crew/unassigned` - lists unassigned crew members
  - `GET /api/admin/crew/:crew_id/requirements` - crew readiness status
  - `POST /api/admin/crew/:crew_id/assign-center` - assign crew to center
- **Demo Cleanup**: `DELETE /api/admin/cleanup-demo-data` - removes all demo data

## Database Changes

- Verified crew table schema alignment with backend expectations
- `crew.assigned_center` remains NULLable for unassigned crew pool
- `crew.profile` JSONB continues to store extended profile data
- All demo data patterns cleaned: crew-%, CRW-%, cus-%, CUS-%, cust-%, etc.

## Frontend Improvements

- **Admin Home**: Complete Create tab redesign with tabbed interface
- **Orders Directory**: Full integration with backend endpoint
- **Crew Assignment**: Interactive assignment cards with readiness indicators
- **User Experience**: Cleaner, more organized Create workflow

## Testing Status

- Admin login and navigation: ✅ Working
- Orders tab listing: ✅ Working  
- Create crew functionality: ✅ Fixed and working
- Crew assignment workflow: ✅ Implemented
- Database cleanup: ✅ Completed (168 records removed)

## Next Steps

- Manager Hub: Add Crew Requirements CRUD tab using `crew_requirements` table
- Warehouse Hub: Implement skeleton structure (backlog/picking/shipped/archive buckets)
- Live Dashboard: Wire metrics from admin endpoints
- Testing: Create comprehensive test users across all roles

## Architecture Notes

- Admin Create workflow now properly separated from Assignment workflow
- Crew creation focuses on identity/profile; assignment happens separately with readiness validation
- Database cleanup maintains referential integrity while removing test data
- Backend endpoints follow consistent patterns with search/pagination support
