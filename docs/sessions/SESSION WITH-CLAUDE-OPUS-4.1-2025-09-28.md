# Session with Claude Opus 4.1 - September 28, 2025

## Session Overview
**Duration**: ~3 hours
**Focus**: Order System Refactoring & Database/UI Testing Infrastructure Setup
**Main Achievement**: Successfully refactored the order system from a broken customer_id-centric model to a proper creator/destination/participants architecture

## Major Changes Since Last Commit

### 1. Order System Complete Refactor ‚úÖ

#### Database Schema Changes
- **Created Migration Files**:
  - `042_order_creator_destination_model.sql` - Renamed columns and updated participants table
  - `043_fix_customer_id_constraint.sql` - Removed NOT NULL constraints from legacy fields
  - `044_update_order_status_constraint.sql` - Added new status values
  - `045_fix_order_items_table.sql` - Added missing line_number column

#### Key Schema Updates:
- Renamed `created_by` ‚Üí `creator_id`
- Renamed `created_by_role` ‚Üí `creator_role`
- Added `next_actor_id` field
- Updated `order_participants` table structure:
  - Changed to use `participant_id` and `participant_role`
  - Added participation types: `creator`, `destination`, `actor`, `watcher`
- Made `customer_id` nullable (no longer required!)

### 2. Code Changes in `apps/backend/server/domains/orders/store.ts`

#### Status System Overhaul
- **New Status Values**:
  ```typescript
  // Product orders
  'pending_warehouse', 'awaiting_delivery', 'delivered'
  // Service orders
  'pending_manager', 'pending_contractor', 'pending_crew',
  'service_in_progress', 'service_completed'
  // Common
  'cancelled', 'rejected'
  ```

#### Order Creation Logic
- **Before**: Forced `customer_id` even when not applicable
- **After**: Properly tracks `creator_id` and `destination`, with participants in separate table
- Centers, Crews, etc. can now create orders without customer_id errors!

#### Viewer Status Logic
- Updated to derive viewer status based on role and participation
- Actors see "pending" when action needed
- Creators see "in-progress"
- Others see appropriate status

### 3. Testing Infrastructure Setup üöÄ

#### MCP Server Configuration
Created complete MCP infrastructure for database and UI testing:

**Files Created**:
- `mcp-servers/` directory with all MCP dependencies
- `mcp-servers/postgres-server.ts` - Custom PostgreSQL server (initial attempt)
- `mcp-servers/test-connection.js` - Database connection tester
- `claude-code.json` - MCP configuration for Claude Code
- `claude-with-db.bat` - Easy launcher script

**Configuration**:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "postgres": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres", "postgresql://..."]
    },
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@playwright/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Documentation Created

### Order System Design Docs
- `docs/ui-flows/orders/ORDER_DATA_MODEL.md` - Complete specification of new order model
- `docs/ui-flows/orders/ORDER_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md` - Updated with creator/destination architecture

### Setup Guides
- `setup-postgres-mcp.md` - Initial MCP setup instructions
- Test scripts in `apps/backend/`:
  - `test-order-system.js` - Verifies migration status
  - `test-new-order.js` - Tests order creation with new model

## Current MVP Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Database schema refactored with new creator/destination model
- Testing infrastructure ready (PostgreSQL + Playwright MCP)
- Migrations created (but need verification)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Partially Resolved
- Fixed: "customer_id cannot be NULL" error
- Fixed: Status constraint violations
- **NOT FIXED**: order_items table still broken - missing multiple columns

### üî¥ CRITICAL: Orders Still Cannot Be Created!
- **order_items table is missing columns** (catalog_item_code, possibly others)
- Creates cannot complete due to order_items insert failures
- Need to identify ALL missing columns and fix at once

### üîÑ In Progress
- Order items table still needs column alignment
- Full order workflow testing needed

### üìã Next Steps
1. **Verify order_items table structure** - Some columns still missing
2. **Test complete order flows**:
   - Product order: Center ‚Üí Warehouse
   - Service order: Customer ‚Üí Manager ‚Üí Contractor ‚Üí Crew
3. **API endpoint testing** - Ensure all order endpoints work
4. **UI testing with Playwright** - Automated testing of order creation/management

## Important Notes for Next Session

### For Next Developer
**Start with this prompt**:
```
URGENT: Order creation is completely broken! Cannot create any orders due to order_items table issues.

I have access to:
- PostgreSQL MCP for database queries
- Playwright MCP for UI testing

CRITICAL FIX NEEDED:
1. Use PostgreSQL MCP to query: SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'order_items'
2. Compare with insertOrderItems function in apps/backend/server/domains/orders/store.ts (line 660+)
3. The function expects these columns that are MISSING:
   - catalog_item_code
   - line_number (we tried to add but may not have worked)
   - Possibly others
4. Create ONE migration to add ALL missing columns at once
5. Test that orders can actually be created!

The creator/destination refactor is done but ORDERS STILL DON'T WORK.

Backend: PORT=4000, Frontend: PORT=3000
Database in apps/backend/.env
```

### Key Files to Review
- `apps/backend/server/domains/orders/store.ts` - Main order logic
- `database/migrations/04*.sql` - Recent migrations
- `docs/ui-flows/orders/ORDER_DATA_MODEL.md` - New order model spec

### Testing Tools Available
- **Database**: Query via PostgreSQL MCP in Claude Code terminal
- **UI**: Automate testing via Playwright MCP
- **Both configured in**: `claude-code.json`
- **Launch with**: `.\claude-with-db.bat`

## Technical Debt Notes
- Legacy fields (customer_id, center_id, etc.) still in database but nullable
- Should eventually be removed after full migration
- order_participants table is the source of truth for involvement

## Session Achievements Summary
1. **Solved the fundamental architecture problem** - Orders no longer require customer_id
2. **Set up comprehensive testing infrastructure** - Database + UI automation ready
3. **Created clear documentation** - Next developer has full context
4. **System is more scalable** - Any entity can create orders for any destination

Thank you for the productive session! The order system is now on solid architectural ground. üéâ
