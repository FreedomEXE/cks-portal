# Session With CODEX — 2025-10-18

This document summarizes today’s changes, refactors, and follow‑ups. It focuses on overview cards modularization and catalog UI alignment, plus a minor AdminHub tab order tweak.

## Changes Since Last Commit
- Modularized hub overview cards into shared presets and shared data builders.
- Refactored hubs (Manager, Contractor, Customer, Center, Crew, Warehouse) to be presentational for their overview sections.
- Added viewerStatus‑based pending orders counting (frontend fallback) to match backend semantics; removed ad‑hoc status sets.
- Fixed catalog card vertical alignment so button rows line up across cards; added tag overflow handling; corrected badge sizing.
- Adjusted AdminHub directory tab order: “Reports & Feedback” now appears before “Training & Procedures”.

## New Features / Shared Modules
- Shared card presets (domain widgets)
  - `packages/domain-widgets/src/overview/cards/{manager,contractor,customer,center,crew,warehouse}.ts`
  - Re‑exported via `packages/domain-widgets/src/overview/index.ts`
- Shared overview data builders (app layer)
  - `apps/frontend/src/shared/overview/builders.ts`
    - `buildManagerOverviewData`
    - `buildContractorOverviewData`
    - `buildCustomerOverviewData`
    - `buildCenterOverviewData`
    - `buildCrewOverviewData`
    - `buildWarehouseOverviewData`
  - `apps/frontend/src/shared/overview/metrics.ts`
    - `countPendingOrdersFromOrders` (uses `viewerStatus === 'pending'`)
    - `capitalizeLabel`, `safeLength`

## Brief Summary of Code Changes
- Hubs now import presets + builders instead of defining overview card arrays and data logic inline.
  - Manager: `apps/frontend/src/hubs/ManagerHub.tsx` → uses `managerOverviewCards` + `buildManagerOverviewData`.
  - Contractor: `apps/frontend/src/hubs/ContractorHub.tsx` → uses `contractorOverviewCards` + `buildContractorOverviewData`.
  - Customer: `apps/frontend/src/hubs/CustomerHub.tsx` → uses `customerOverviewCards` + `buildCustomerOverviewData`.
  - Center: `apps/frontend/src/hubs/CenterHub.tsx` → uses `centerOverviewCards` + `buildCenterOverviewData`.
  - Crew: `apps/frontend/src/hubs/CrewHub.tsx` → uses `crewOverviewCards` + `buildCrewOverviewData`.
  - Warehouse: `apps/frontend/src/hubs/WarehouseHub.tsx` → uses `warehouseOverviewCards` + `buildWarehouseOverviewData`.
- Catalog adjustments (shared Card component in `CKSCatalog.tsx`):
  - Fixed header area with consistent height to align buttons across cards (handles missing subtitle/badge via invisible placeholders).
  - Tag cap (default 3) with “+N more” chip to prevent card height inflation.
  - Badge rendered as `inline-flex self-start` to prevent width stretching.
- AdminHub tab order: `apps/frontend/src/hubs/AdminHub.tsx` moved “Reports & Feedback” before “Training & Procedures”.

## Next Steps / Important Files
- JSON‑config future: the new preset/builder split enables an easy migration to JSON definitions later. 
  - Preset JSON idea: `{ id, title, dataKey, color, icon, thresholds }`.
  - Compute registry for advanced values if needed.
- Consider extracting AdminHub overview to presets/builders similarly (not changed today).
- Optional UI polish: icons/trend deltas/threshold colors in `OverviewCard` (single shared change).
- Validation: run full TS typecheck and resolve unrelated pre‑existing errors flagged during a quick tsc run.
- Full flow verification: expand testing beyond “orders and viewing product orders”. See Testing notes.

## Current Roadblocks / Notes
- TypeScript errors exist elsewhere in the repo (not introduced by today’s changes). We avoided modifying unrelated modules.
- RBAC remains enforced server‑side; the refactor only moves presentation/config/data shaping. No access control impact.

## Build Towards MVP — Where We Are
- Overview cards are now modular and consistent across hubs, aligning with post‑MVP plan to make hubs more presentational/JSON‑driven.
- Catalog UI feels more consistent; card button rows align across products and services.
- Small AdminHub UX improvement (tab order) landed.

## Testing / What’s Verified Today
- Verified the catalog card alignment fixes visually for both products and services.
- Verified orders and viewing orders for products specifically, per your note.
- Not all flows are tested — more coverage recommended:
  - All hubs: overview metrics sanity vs dashboard/scope endpoints
  - Pending orders: confirm viewerStatus mapping for each role
  - Certified services counts per role
  - Warehouse inventory/low stock from dashboard

## Affected Docs Updated
- Architecture: added a short section noting location and purpose of overview presets/builders.

## File Index (Key Changes)
- Domain widgets (presets):
  - `packages/domain-widgets/src/overview/cards/*`
  - `packages/domain-widgets/src/overview/index.ts`
- App shared overview logic:
  - `apps/frontend/src/shared/overview/builders.ts`
  - `apps/frontend/src/shared/overview/metrics.ts`
- Hubs:
  - `apps/frontend/src/hubs/{ManagerHub,ContractorHub,CustomerHub,CenterHub,CrewHub,WarehouseHub}.tsx`
- Catalog UI:
  - `apps/frontend/src/pages/CKSCatalog.tsx`
- Admin tab order:
  - `apps/frontend/src/hubs/AdminHub.tsx`

If you want me to prep the JSON config scaffolding next (presets as JSON + simple compute registry), I can draft that in a follow‑up session.
