# SESSION WITH-CODEX — 2025-10-01

Agent: Codex (CLI)

## Summary (since last commit)

This session focused on unifying and polishing the Order Details experience across roles, tightening the order workflow visualization, and simplifying the product‑order creation flow. We also added guardrails for edits and made status/availability information clearer. Key backend changes support cancellation reason separation and (for new orders) minimal contact enrichment in order metadata so warehouse can view destination/requestor info.

---

## Changes Made

### Backend
- orders/store.ts
  - Creator workflow stage now remains canonical "requested" regardless of final status.
  - When cancelling, store `metadata.cancellationReason`, `metadata.cancelledBy`, `metadata.cancelledAt` without overwriting `notes` (special instructions).
  - Added `archivedAt` to outbound HubOrderItem payload.
  - On createOrder(), enrich `metadata.contacts` with minimal contact for requestor and destination (new orders only) so warehouse can see names/phone/email/address without profile calls.
- orders/types.ts
  - Added `archivedAt?: string | null` to `HubOrderItem`.

### Orders API (admin helpers)
- orders/routes.fastify.ts
  - Admin endpoints to archive/restore/hard‑delete order rows (to keep hub views consistent with Admin Archive actions).

### Frontend — Shared UI
- OrderDetailsModal (packages/ui)
  - Added status chip at top (color‑coded: pending=yellow, in‑progress=blue, completed=green, cancelled/rejected=red).
  - Added Availability Window row; removed expected‑delivery date from modal.
  - Added dedicated Cancellation Reason section with Cancelled By/At.
- OrderCard (packages/ui)
  - Creator stage now green (completed), pending stage yellow (only current pending pulses).
  - "Date Requested" shows `YYYY‑MM‑DD - h:mm AM/PM TZ`.
- OrdersSection (packages/domain-widgets)
  - Always includes "View Details" in actions along with policy actions (e.g., Cancel for creators at pending stage).
  - Destination shown in the at‑a‑glance section (with safe fallbacks).

### Frontend — Hubs
- CenterHub / CustomerHub
  - Wire Cancel action to backend; keep View Details visible.
  - Pass status to Order Details; pass availability, cancellation metadata.
- WarehouseHub
  - For Requestor/Delivery blocks, fall back to `order.metadata.contacts.{requestor,destination}` when profile is not available/authorized.
  - Pass status, availability, and cancellation metadata to the modal.
- AdminHub
  - Hydration now merges `metadata` from `/api/orders/:id` so Availability Window appears in Admin view.
  - Edited order modal now only edits Notes (expected date removed per new design).

### Frontend — Catalog
- CKSCatalog (products)
  - Added simple Availability Window capture (Mon–Sun selector + time range; tz from browser) stored as `metadata.availability` when placing a product order.

---

## New Features
- Status chip in Order Details with color mapping and role‑aware status text.
- Availability Window replaces Expected Delivery Date across UI for product orders.
- Creators always see "View Details" in actions alongside Cancel (when pending).
- Dedicated Cancellation Reason section; Special Instructions remain separate.
- Minimal contact bundling on new orders for requestor/destination so Warehouse can see contact info without extra permissions.

---

## Brief Code Change Summary
- Backend: policy‑safe mapping (creator stage stability), cancellation metadata, archivedAt propagation, createOrder metadata enrichment.
- UI: Order Details status chip + availability/cancellation sections; improved date formatting and action set; creator stage color logic.
- Admin: helper archive endpoints + hydration improvements; edit modal limited to notes.

---

## Next Steps / Important Files

### Next Steps
- Backfill existing orders with `metadata.contacts` so Warehouse sees Requestor/Delivery contact info for historical records (today’s enrichment applies to new orders only).
- Optional: add small icons to status chip (check, clock, x) and surface "Pending Warehouse" label when appropriate via nextActorRole.
- Decide whether service orders should also use Availability Window.

### Important Files
- Backend
  - apps/backend/server/domains/orders/store.ts
  - apps/backend/server/domains/orders/routes.fastify.ts
  - apps/backend/server/domains/orders/types.ts
- Frontend
  - packages/ui/src/modals/OrderDetailsModal/OrderDetailsModal.tsx
  - packages/ui/src/cards/OrderCard/OrderCard.tsx
  - packages/domain-widgets/src/OrdersSection/OrdersSection.tsx
  - apps/frontend/src/hubs/{AdminHub,WarehouseHub,CenterHub,CustomerHub}.tsx
  - apps/frontend/src/pages/CKSCatalog.tsx

---

## Current Roadblocks
- Warehouse still does not see full Requestor/Delivery info for orders created before today’s enrichment (no metadata.contacts on older rows). Requires backfill or fallback fetch that’s authorized for warehouse to read minimal profile fields.
- Some legacy docs and schema references still mention `expected_date`; UI no longer uses it for product orders.

---

## MVP Status
- Orders end‑to‑end flow is functionally consistent across roles for viewing and basic actions (View Details, Cancel for creators, Accept/Reject/Deliver for warehouse).
- Order Details is standardized with status chip, availability, special instructions, items, and cancellation reason.
- Outstanding to reach MVP polish:
  - Backfill contact metadata for existing orders (warehouse UX).
  - Finalize chips/icons and minor style refinements.
  - Confirm service‑order handling of availability (if needed) and finalize admin‑side docs.

---

## Doc Updates
- Updated `docs/ui-flows/orders/ORDER_FLOW.md` to reflect new color mapping, canonical creator stage, and availability.
- Updated `docs/ui-flows/orders/ORDER_DATA_MODEL_ADDENDUM.md` with:
  - `metadata.availability` (tz, days, window)
  - `metadata.contacts` (requestor, destination)
  - `metadata.cancellationReason`, `cancelledBy`, `cancelledAt`

---

## Notes
- Existing archived order fallback was implemented, but we agreed to pause user‑archive surfacing for admin‑archived orders to reduce scope.
