# Session Summary — GPT-5 — 2025-10-16

This document captures the work performed in this session, major code changes, known gaps, and recommended next steps.

## Changes Since Last Commit

- Added a unified backend endpoint to fetch complete, role‑scoped order details: `GET /api/order/:orderId/details`.
- Implemented soft admin detection (no forced 403) so hub roles can access order details (RBAC scoped).
- Added RBAC helper to fetch a single order visible to the viewer.
- Converted the frontend to a fetch‑first model for order details (one data shape across ActivityFeed and modals).
- Replaced per‑hub modal wiring with a shared `OrderDetailsGateway` component (all 7 hubs).
- Updated ActivityFeed to use the canonical endpoint and derive state; legacy `/entity/...` is used only as a 404 fallback for deleted orders.
- Enriched backend metadata on cancel/reject with resolved actor identity (code + name) and timestamps; surfaced in the UI.
- Fixed several latent build issues (stray `\n` fragments, TS parse errors, Vite package resolution).

## New Features Added

- One canonical order details path for all roles/states (active/cancelled/archived/deleted) via `/api/order/:id/details`.
- `OrderDetailsGateway` — a shared component that selects and renders the correct order modal (product/service) from a single hook.
- “Who did it” display for order cancellations and rejections in modals:
  - Cancelled By: `ID – Name` + timestamp
  - Rejected By: `ID – Name` + timestamp

## Brief Summary of Code Changes

### Backend
- `apps/backend/server/domains/orders/routes.fastify.ts`
  - Added `GET /api/order/:orderId/details`.
  - Uses `authenticate` + `getAdminUserByClerkId` for soft admin check.
  - Non‑admin path: `requireActiveRole` + `fetchOrderForViewer` (RBAC single‑order fetch).

- `apps/backend/server/domains/orders/store.ts`
  - Added `fetchOrderForViewer(role, cksCode, orderId)`.
  - On `cancel` action, write: `cancellationReason`, `cancelledByCode/Name/Display`, `cancelledAt`.
  - On `reject` action, stage: `rejectedByCode/Name/Display`, `rejectedAt` (and keep `rejection_reason`).
  - Fixed broken SQL and string interpolation introduced while adding the reject metadata block.

### Frontend
- `apps/frontend/src/shared/utils/activityHelpers.ts`
  - `fetchOrderForActivity` now calls canonical details endpoint and derives state; legacy `/entity/...` only on 404.

- `apps/frontend/src/hooks/useOrderDetails.ts`
  - Rewritten to fetch‑first from `/api/order/:id/details` (no `directoryContext` / `viewerRole`).
  - Returns normalized order + derived blocks (requestor, destination, availability, archive, cancellation info).
  - New fields for rejections: `rejectedBy`, `rejectedAt`.
  - Cancellation display prefers `cancelledByDisplay` → formats `ID – Name` fallback.

- `apps/frontend/src/components/OrderDetailsGateway.tsx`
  - New gateway; passes unified props to modals, including `rejectedBy` / `rejectedAt`.

- `packages/ui/src/modals/ProductOrderModal/…` and `…/ServiceOrderModal/…`
  - Added “Rejected By / Rejected At” section.
  - Product modal also re‑orders display precedence for Requestor/Destination names.

- Hubs (all 7): Admin, Manager, Center, Customer, Contractor, Crew, Warehouse
  - Removed per‑hub modal selection and legacy `useOrderDetails` calls.
  - Switched to `<OrderDetailsGateway orderId={selectedOrderId} … />`.
  - Cleaned stray `\n` artifacts introduced by previous edits.

- `apps/frontend/vite.config.mts`
  - Added alias for `@cks/domain-widgets` → workspace `src/index.ts` to avoid missing `dist` in local dev/build.

## Next Steps / Important Files

- Validate “who cancelled/rejected” display end‑to‑end in fresh data:
  - Some existing orders may not yet have `cancelledByCode/Name/Display` or `rejectedBy*` in metadata until a new action is taken post‑deploy. Confirm by performing a fresh cancel/reject and re‑opening details.
  - Important files: 
    - Backend: `orders/store.ts` (`cancel` / `reject` cases), `orders/routes.fastify.ts` (details endpoint)
    - Frontend: `useOrderDetails.ts`, `OrderDetailsGateway.tsx`, both modals under `packages/ui/src/modals/…`

- Consider alias for `@cks/ui` similar to `@cks/domain-widgets` if UI `dist` is missing in dev.
- Add a predev/prebuild step to build packages (domain‑widgets/ui) if you want to rely on `dist` instead of aliases.

## Current Roadblocks

- Reported: Cancelled orders still show role (e.g., “crew”) instead of `ID – Name` in some views.
  - Hypotheses:
    1) The order being viewed predates the new enrichment; metadata still has only `cancelledBy` (role) without the new `*Code/Name/Display` fields.
    2) Another code path is returning a cached/legacy payload (e.g., an older entity response) for that specific click path.
  - Quick verification path (next session):
    - Perform a fresh cancel on a test order; confirm new metadata keys exist in DB and payload; validate UI shows `ID – Name`.

## Where We Are Toward MVP

- “One hook, one modal, one data path” largely achieved:
  - Canonical endpoint exists and is consumed everywhere (ActivityFeed and modals).
  - All hubs use the shared gateway component.
  - Product/Service order detail parity improved; archive/cancel/reject banners/sections unified.
  - Known gap remains on cancelled/rejected actor display for legacy data.

## Other Relevant Info

- Touch points updated in docs:
  - `docs/ACTIVITY_MODAL_ROUTING_PLAN.md` — note about canonical endpoint usage and legacy fallback.
  - `docs/MODAL_CONSOLIDATION_REFACTOR_PLAN_AMENDMENTS.md` — status update that gateway is now adopted in all hubs.

## Verification Scope (This Session)

- Verified order detail flows primarily for product orders and viewing via ActivityFeed and hub directories. Service flows and other actions (deliver/complete) were not fully regression tested due to time.
