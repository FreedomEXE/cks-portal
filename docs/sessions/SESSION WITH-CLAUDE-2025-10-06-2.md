## Changes Made Since Last Commit

### 1. Backend Service Data Enhancement

**File**: `apps/backend/server/domains/services/service.ts`

#### Enhanced `getServiceById()` Function (Lines 126-155)

**Problem**: Service modal was showing "No crew assigned yet" even though crew members had accepted assignments.

**Root Cause**: The function was only looking at `metadata.crew` array, but older services had accepted crews stored only in `metadata.crewRequests` array without being added to `metadata.crew`.

**Solution**: Added fallback logic to build crew array from accepted `crewRequests`:

```typescript
// Lines 126-155
// Enrich metadata with crew names
const metadata = row.metadata || {};
let crewCodes: string[] = Array.isArray((metadata as any).crew) ? (metadata as any).crew : [];

// If no crew array but there are accepted crewRequests, build crew array from those
if (crewCodes.length === 0 && Array.isArray((metadata as any).crewRequests)) {
  const acceptedCrews = (metadata as any).crewRequests
    .filter((req: any) => req.status === 'accepted' && req.crewCode)
    .map((req: any) => req.crewCode);
  crewCodes = acceptedCrews;
}

if (crewCodes.length > 0) {
  // Fetch crew names from database
  const crewResult = await query<{ crew_id: string; name: string }>(
    `SELECT crew_id, name FROM crew WHERE crew_id = ANY($1::text[]) AND archived_at IS NULL`,
    [crewCodes]
  );

  // Build crew array with code and name
  const enrichedCrew = crewCodes.map(code => {
    const crewRow = crewResult.rows.find(r => r.crew_id === code);
    return {
      code: code,
      name: crewRow?.name || code
    };
  });

  (metadata as any).crew = enrichedCrew;
}
```

**Impact**:
- All services now display accepted crew members correctly in ServiceViewModal
- Handles both legacy data (crews in crewRequests only) and new data (crews in metadata.crew)
- Enriches crew codes with actual crew names from database

#### Already Fixed: `respondToServiceCrewRequest()` Function (Lines 294-300)

**Note**: This fix was made in previous session but is documented here for completeness.

**Problem**: When crew accepted assignment, their code wasn't being added to `metadata.crew` array.

**Solution**: Updated function to add crew code to `metadata.crew` when accepting:

```typescript
// Lines 294-300
if (input.accept) {
  const currentCrew: string[] = Array.isArray((updatedMetadata as any).crew)
    ? (updatedMetadata as any).crew : [];
  if (!currentCrew.includes(code)) {
    (updatedMetadata as any).crew = [...currentCrew, code];
  }
}
```

**Impact**: New crew acceptances will properly populate `metadata.crew` going forward.

---

### 2. Catalog Navigation Filtering

**Files Modified**: 5 hub files
- `apps/frontend/src/hubs/ContractorHub.tsx` (Lines 870-871)
- `apps/frontend/src/hubs/CustomerHub.tsx` (Lines 630-631)
- `apps/frontend/src/hubs/CenterHub.tsx` (Lines 628-629)
- `apps/frontend/src/hubs/CrewHub.tsx` (Lines 702-703)
- `apps/frontend/src/hubs/ManagerHub.tsx` (Similar pattern)

**Problem**: "Order Services" and "Order Products" buttons both opened catalog showing all tabs instead of filtering to the specific type.

**Solution**: Added URL query parameters to navigation calls:

```typescript
// Before
onCreateServiceOrder={() => navigate('/catalog')}
onCreateProductOrder={() => navigate('/catalog')}

// After
onCreateServiceOrder={() => navigate('/catalog?mode=services')}
onCreateProductOrder={() => navigate('/catalog?mode=products')}
```

**Impact**:
- Users clicking "Order Services" now see only the Services catalog tab
- Users clicking "Order Products" now see only the Products catalog tab
- "Browse CKS Catalog" button remains unchanged (shows both tabs)

---

### 3. Product-Service Linkage Display

**Problem**: When a product order is created for a specific service, there was no visual indication in the order details showing this relationship.

**Data Already Exists**: Product orders created from services already store `metadata.serviceId`.

#### Updated Modal Interfaces

**File**: `packages/ui/src/modals/OrderDetailsModal/OrderDetailsModal.tsx`

**Changes**:
1. Added `serviceId` to order interface (Line 27):
```typescript
order: {
  orderId: string;
  orderType: 'service' | 'product';
  title: string | null;
  requestedBy: string | null;
  destination: string | null;
  requestedDate: string | null;
  notes: string | null;
  status?: string | null;
  items?: OrderLineItem[];
  serviceId?: string | null;  // NEW
} | null;
```

2. Added "Related Service" section (Lines 177-199):
```tsx
{/* Related Service Section - only for product orders linked to a service */}
{order.orderType === 'product' && order.serviceId && (
  <section className={styles.section}>
    <h3 className={styles.sectionTitle}>Related Service</h3>
    <div className={styles.grid}>
      <div className={styles.field}>
        <label className={styles.label}>Service ID</label>
        <p className={styles.value} style={{ color: '#2563eb', fontWeight: 500 }}>
          {order.serviceId}
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div style={{
      marginTop: 12,
      padding: '10px 12px',
      background: '#eff6ff',
      border: '1px solid #bfdbfe',
      borderRadius: 6,
      fontSize: 13,
      color: '#1e40af',
    }}>
      ℹ️ This product order was created for service <strong>{order.serviceId}</strong>
    </div>
  </section>
)}
```

**File**: `packages/ui/src/modals/ProductOrderModal/ProductOrderModal.tsx`

**Changes**:
1. Added `serviceId` to order interface (Line 25)
2. Updated existing service link section to use `order.serviceId` instead of `order.metadata.serviceId` (Lines 138-162)

#### Updated All Hubs to Pass serviceId

**Files Modified**: 7 hub files
- ContractorHub.tsx (Line 972)
- CustomerHub.tsx
- CenterHub.tsx
- CrewHub.tsx
- ManagerHub.tsx
- WarehouseHub.tsx (Line 1079)
- AdminHub.tsx (Line 1672)

**Change Pattern**:
```typescript
const commonOrder = selectedOrderForDetails
  ? {
      orderId: selectedOrderForDetails.orderId,
      title: selectedOrderForDetails.title || null,
      // ... other fields
      serviceId: ((selectedOrderForDetails as any)?.metadata?.serviceId) || null,  // NEW
    }
  : null;
```

**Impact**:
- Product orders created for services now display a "Related Service" section
- Shows the service ID with blue highlighting
- Includes informational banner explaining the relationship
- Works across all user hubs

---

### 4. UI Package Rebuild

**Action**: Rebuilt `@cks/ui` package to apply modal interface changes

**Command**: `pnpm --filter @cks/ui build`

**Result**: Successfully built with updated TypeScript definitions for modal props

- Maintains backward compatibility with old data

### 2. Service-Product Order Linking UI
- Visual relationship display in product order modals
- Clear indication when a product order is part of a service workflow
- Helps users understand order context and dependencies

### 3. Context-Aware Catalog Navigation
- Smart filtering based on user intent (services vs products)
- Reduces cognitive load by showing only relevant catalog items
- Maintains option for browsing full catalog when needed

---

## Code Changes Summary

## Testing Performed

### Manual Testing
1. **Service CEN-010-SRV-001**: Verified in database
   - Has accepted crew CRW-006 (Wario) in `crewRequests`
   - No `metadata.crew` array (legacy data)
   - Backend now correctly extracts and enriches crew data

2. **Catalog Navigation**: Verified URL parameters
   - "Order Services" → `/catalog?mode=services`
   - "Order Products" → `/catalog?mode=products`
   - "Browse Catalog" → `/catalog` (unchanged)

3. **Product Order Modals**: Verified service linkage display
   - Product orders with `metadata.serviceId` show "Related Service" section
   - Product orders without service link show normal layout

### Database Queries
- Confirmed crew CRW-006 exists with name "Wario"
- Confirmed service CEN-010-SRV-001 structure and metadata
- Verified crewRequests acceptance data

## Key Learnings & Patterns

### 1. Backward Compatibility Pattern
When enhancing data structures, always provide fallback logic for legacy data:
```typescript
// Check new structure first
let data = metadata.newField || [];

// Fallback to old structure if empty
if (data.length === 0 && metadata.oldField) {
  data = transformOldToNew(metadata.oldField);
}
```

### 2. URL Query Parameters for Navigation
Use query parameters to pre-filter views without adding new routes:
```typescript
navigate('/catalog?mode=services')  // Filters to services
navigate('/catalog?mode=products')  // Filters to products
navigate('/catalog')                 // Shows all
```

### 3. Metadata Enrichment at Read Time
Enrich entity codes with names when fetching, not when storing:
```typescript
// Store: Just save the code
metadata.crew = ['CRW-006'];

// Read: Enrich with names
const enrichedCrew = await fetchCrewNames(metadata.crew);
metadata.crew = enrichedCrew.map(c => ({ code: c.id, name: c.name }));
```

### 4. Modal Prop Interface Design
Keep modal interfaces flexible with optional fields:
```typescript
interface ModalProps {
  required: string;
  optional?: string | null;  // Allows graceful degradation
}
```

---

## Technical Debt & Future Improvements

### 1. Data Migration for Legacy Services
Consider running a one-time migration script to populate `metadata.crew` for all existing services with accepted `crewRequests`:
```sql
UPDATE orders
SET metadata = metadata || jsonb_build_object(
  'crew',
  (SELECT jsonb_agg(req->>'crewCode')
   FROM jsonb_array_elements(metadata->'crewRequests') req
   WHERE req->>'status' = 'accepted')
)
WHERE transformed_id IS NOT NULL
  AND (metadata->'crew' IS NULL OR jsonb_array_length(metadata->'crew') = 0)
  AND metadata->'crewRequests' IS NOT NULL;
```

### 2. Toast Notification Library
Consider adding a dedicated toast library instead of using `window.alert()` and `window.prompt()`:
- **Recommended**: react-hot-toast (lightweight, customizable)
- **Alternative**: react-toastify (more features, larger bundle)

### 3. Service Action Buttons Architecture
Plan service action buttons to be:
- Role-aware (only show to authorized users)
- Status-aware (only show when action is valid)
- Optimistically updated (instant UI feedback)
- With confirmation for destructive actions

### 4. Catalog Architecture for Warehouse Services
Design considerations:
- Separate warehouse service types from regular services
- Different approval workflow (warehouse-specific)
- May need new service categories/tags
- Consider if warehouse services need different pricing/billing
