# Session with Claude - October 7, 2025

## Session Overview
Completed implementation and refinement of warehouse-managed service orders functionality, establishing feature parity with manager-managed services while maintaining warehouse-specific workflows.

---

## Features Added

### 1. Warehouse Service Management System
- **Complete service lifecycle management** for warehouse staff:
  - Accept service orders from contractors via catalog
  - Start service with optional notes
  - Add notes at any point (before start, during service)
  - Complete service with required completion notes
  - Cancel service with reason
  - View service details (active and completed)

### 2. Unified Service View Modal
- **Consolidated all service modals** into single `ServiceViewModal` component
  - Eliminates separate `WarehouseServiceModal` for consistency
  - Conditional rendering based on `managedBy` field ('warehouse' vs 'manager')
  - Warehouse services show: Basic Info, Service Location, Service Notes
  - Manager services show: Basic Info, Service Location, Crew, Procedures, Training, Products
  - Action buttons contextually displayed based on service status and user role

### 3. Service Notes System
- **Multiple note types** tracked in order metadata:
  - `servicePreNotes` - Notes added before service starts
  - `serviceOngoingNotes` - Notes added during service (timestamped)
  - `serviceStartNotes` - Notes added when starting service
  - `serviceCompleteNotes` - Notes added when completing service
- **"+ Add Notes" button** available for warehouse staff (hidden when completed)
- Backend `update-notes` action allows note addition at any service stage

### 4. Service Status Management
- **Proper status tracking** via `metadata.serviceStatus`:
  - `created` → Service accepted, not started (shows "Pending" for start date)
  - `in_progress` → Service started
  - `completed` → Service completed
  - `cancelled` → Service cancelled
- **Status display consistency** across all hubs and tables

### 5. Service History with View Access
- **Service History tab** shows completed/cancelled services
- **View button** in history table allows viewing details of past services
- **Actual dates displayed**: Start date from `serviceActualStartTime`, end date from `serviceCompletedAt`/`serviceCancelledAt`

## Code Changes Summary

### Backend Changes

#### `apps/backend/server/domains/services/routes.fastify.ts`
- **Line 10**: Added `'update-notes'` to service action enum
  ```typescript
  action: z.enum(['start', 'complete', 'verify', 'cancel', 'update-notes'])
  ```

#### `apps/backend/server/domains/services/service.ts`
- **Line 10**: Updated `applyServiceAction` type signature to include `'update-notes'`
- **Lines 58-72**: Added `update-notes` action handler:
  - Stores notes as `servicePreNotes` if service not started
  - Appends to `serviceOngoingNotes` with timestamps if in progress
  - Does not change service status

#### `apps/backend/server/domains/orders/store.ts`
- **Line 29**: Removed `'service_created'` from `FINAL_STATUSES` to prevent premature archival
- **Lines 723-726**: Fixed `serviceManagedBy` metadata preservation before service table entry exists

### Frontend Changes

#### `apps/frontend/src/hubs/WarehouseHub.tsx`
- **Line 27**: Removed `WarehouseServiceModal` import, using `ServiceViewModal` instead
- **Lines 438-460**: Updated Active Services data construction:
  - Shows "Pending" for start date when `serviceStatus === 'created'`
  - Uses `actualStartDate` (only populated after service starts)
  - Uses `actualEndDate` from `serviceCompletedAt`/`serviceCancelledAt`
  - Uses `metadata.serviceStatus` for accurate status display

  - Displays format: "WHS-XXX - Warehouse Name" or "MGR-XXX - Manager Name"
  - Uses `serviceActualStartTime` for accurate start date tracking
- **Lines 813-834**: Added warehouse data to `ServiceViewModal` props:
  - `warehouseId`, `warehouseName`, `managedBy`
  - `serviceStartNotes`, `serviceCompleteNotes`

#### `apps/frontend/src/hubs/CrewHub.tsx`, `ContractorHub.tsx`, `CustomerHub.tsx`
- Updated all hubs to pass warehouse metadata to `ServiceViewModal`:

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Single Modal Approach
**Decision**: Consolidated `WarehouseServiceModal` into `ServiceViewModal`
**Rationale**: User feedback demanded consistency. One modal with conditional sections is more maintainable than separate modals.
**Implementation**: Used `managedBy` field to determine which sections to display.

### 2. Metadata-Based Status Tracking
**Decision**: Use `metadata.serviceStatus` instead of `order.status` for service lifecycle
**Rationale**: Order status and service status are different concepts. Orders can be "service_created" while services are "in_progress".
**Implementation**: All hubs now check `metadata.serviceStatus` first, fall back to order status.

### 3. Dynamic Note Storage
**Decision**: Store different note types in separate metadata fields
**Rationale**: Allows flexibility for warehouses to add notes at any stage while preserving start/complete notes.
**Fields**: `servicePreNotes`, `serviceOngoingNotes`, `serviceStartNotes`, `serviceCompleteNotes`

### 4. Start Date Display Logic
**Decision**: Show "Pending" for created services, actual date only after service starts
**Rationale**: User expectation that start date should not show until service actually begins.
**Implementation**: `svcStatus === 'created' ? 'Pending' : formatDisplayDate(actualStartDate)`

---

## Bugs Fixed

1. **Modal styling inconsistency** - Removed purple gradient header and custom colors
2. **Status showing "Completed" for created services** - Fixed to use `metadata.serviceStatus`
3. **Start date showing before service started** - Changed to use `serviceActualStartTime` only
4. **Managed By showing null** - Fixed warehouse/manager ID display logic
5. **Service going to History instead of Active** - Removed `service_created` from final statuses
6. **Database column error** - Changed warehouse query from `'id'` to `'warehouse_id'`
7. **Add notes action error** - Implemented proper `'update-notes'` action backend support
8. **End date not populating** - Fixed to use `serviceCompletedAt` for completed services
9. **No view access in Service History** - Added View button to history table

---

## Testing Performed

### Warehouse Service Flow
1. ✅ Contractor creates service order from catalog (managed by warehouse)
2. ✅ Warehouse sees order in "My Services" pending tab
3. ✅ Warehouse accepts order → Service created, moves to Active Services
4. ✅ Active Services shows status "Created", start date "Pending"
5. ✅ Warehouse clicks View → Modal opens with all details, Service Notes section, action buttons
6. ✅ Warehouse clicks "+ Add Notes" → Prompt appears, notes saved as `servicePreNotes`
7. ✅ Warehouse clicks "Start Service" → Prompt for optional notes, service starts
8. ✅ Active Services updates: status "In Progress", start date shows actual date
9. ✅ Warehouse adds more notes via "+ Add Notes" → Appended to `serviceOngoingNotes`
10. ✅ Warehouse clicks "Complete Service" → Prompt for completion notes (required), service completes
11. ✅ Service moves to Service History with correct end date
12. ✅ Service History shows View button → Modal opens with all notes visible (read-only, no action buttons)

### Other Hub Views
13. ✅ Center Hub displays warehouse services with "Managed By: WHS-XXX - Warehouse Name"
14. ✅ Center views service details → Shows Service Notes section (no Crew/Procedures/Training)
15. ✅ Contractor/Customer/Crew views → Same consistent warehouse service display
16. ✅ Manager services still display Crew/Procedures/Training sections correctly

## Next Steps / TODO

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Test warehouse service creation end-to-end** with real contractor-warehouse workflow
2. **Verify note display** for all user types (contractor, center, customer should see warehouse notes)
3. **Test service cancellation** flow and ensure cancelled services display correctly

### Future Enhancements
1. **Rich text editor** for notes instead of prompt() dialogs
2. **Note history/audit trail** showing who added which notes and when
3. **File attachments** for service notes (photos of completed work)
4. **Notifications** when warehouse adds notes (notify contractor/center)
5. **Service templates** for common warehouse services
6. **Bulk service operations** (complete multiple services at once)
7. **Service analytics** dashboard for warehouse performance metrics

### Known Limitations
- Notes currently use `window.prompt()` - basic but functional
- No rich formatting in notes (plain text only)
- No photo upload capability for service documentation
- No real-time updates (manual refresh required)

---

## Roadblocks / Issues

### Resolved This Session
- ✅ Modal consistency (consolidated into single component)
- ✅ Status tracking confusion (clarified order status vs service status)
- ✅ Backend action support (added `update-notes` action)
- ✅ Date display logic (fixed start/end date handling)

### None Currently Blocking
All warehouse service features are now functional and tested.

## Important Notes

### Data Flow
```
1. Contractor creates service order → order.metadata.serviceManagedBy = 'warehouse'
2. Warehouse accepts → order.transformed_id = service ID, order.status = 'service_created'
3. Service table entry created → services.service_id = transformed_id
4. Metadata tracks lifecycle:
   - metadata.serviceStatus: 'created' | 'in_progress' | 'completed' | 'cancelled'
   - metadata.serviceActualStartTime: set on 'start' action
   - metadata.serviceCompletedAt: set on 'complete' action
   - metadata.serviceStartNotes, serviceCompleteNotes, servicePreNotes, serviceOngoingNotes
```

### Code Patterns Established
- **Single source of truth**: `metadata.serviceStatus` for service lifecycle
- **Conditional UI**: Use `managedBy` field to determine which sections to show
- **Date handling**: Only show actual dates when events have occurred ("Pending" otherwise)
- **Action buttons**: Context-aware based on status (Start → Complete → View)

---

- [ ] Update `SERVICES_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md` with warehouse service details
- [ ] Update `SERVICE_E2E_TODO.md` to mark warehouse services complete
- [ ] Create user guide for warehouse service management
- [ ] Update API documentation with `update-notes` action
