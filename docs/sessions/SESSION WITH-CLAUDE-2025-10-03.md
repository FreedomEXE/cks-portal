## Changes Made Since Last Commit

### 1. Backend Changes

#### `apps/backend/server/domains/orders/store.ts`
**Service Creation Logic (Lines 1761-1927)**:
- **Fixed center code resolution** for service ID generation:
  - Now searches: `center_id` ‚Üí `destination` ‚Üí `participants` (center role)
  - Added fallback to find center from order participants
  - Improved error message for missing center

- **Added service record creation**:
  - When `create-service` action executes, now inserts record into `services` table
  - Generates service ID format: `{CENTER_CODE}-SRV-{SEQ}` (e.g., `CEN-010-SRV-001`)
  - Uses correct column name `service_name` (not `name`)
  - Sets service status to `'active'` on creation
  - Stores service type and metadata from order

**Key Code Addition**:
```typescript
// If creating a service, insert into services table
if (input.action === "create-service" && transformedId) {
  await query(
    `INSERT INTO services (service_id, service_name, status, category, ...)
     VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, ...)
     ON CONFLICT (service_id) DO UPDATE SET ...`
  );
}
```

#### `packages/policies/src/orderPolicy.ts`
**Extended Manager Actions**:
- Managers can now execute `create-service` at multiple statuses:
  - `manager_accepted`: Initial status after manager approval
  - `crew_requested`: After requesting crew assignment
  - `crew_assigned`: After crew accepts assignment

**Before**:
```typescript
manager: {
  'manager_accepted': ['create-service'],
  'crew_requested': [], // Watch only
  'crew_assigned': []   // Watch only
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
manager: {
  'manager_accepted': ['create-service'],
  'crew_requested': ['create-service'],  // Can create after requesting crew
  'crew_assigned': ['create-service']    // Can create after crew assigned
}
```

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### All Hub Files (Manager, Contractor, Crew, Customer, Center)
**Service Visibility Logic Updated**:

**Active Services Filter** - Now includes created services:
```typescript
// OLD: Only pending/in-progress/approved
return status === 'pending' || status === 'in-progress' || status === 'approved';

// NEW: Includes all active statuses including created services
return status === 'pending' || status === 'in-progress' || status === 'approved'
    || status === 'delivered' || status === 'service-created' || status === 'completed';
```

**Service History Filter** - Now only shows terminated services:
```typescript
// OLD: Included completed services
return status === 'delivered' || status === 'service-created'
    || status === 'cancelled' || status === 'rejected';

// NEW: Only cancelled/rejected
return status === 'cancelled' || status === 'rejected';
```

**Impact**:
- Created services now appear in **Active Services** tab for all users
- Service History only shows truly terminated (cancelled/rejected) services
- Services remain visible and actionable until explicitly completed

## New Features Added

### ‚úÖ Complete Service Order Flow (E2E)

1. **Order Creation** (any role: customer, center, contractor)
2. **Approval Chain** (customer ‚Üí contractor ‚Üí manager)
3. **Manager Accepts** (status: `manager_accepted`)
4. **Manager Adds Crew** (status: `crew_requested`)
   - Manager can select multiple crew members
   - Each crew receives request in their orders tab
5. **Crew Response** (crew accepts/rejects)
   - First acceptance: status ‚Üí `crew_assigned`
   - Crew member assigned to order
6. **Manager Creates Service** (status: `service_created`)
   - Service record inserted into database
   - Service ID generated: `{CENTER}-SRV-{SEQ}`
   - Order marked as completed
   - Service appears in Active Services for all participants

### ‚úÖ Service Visibility System

**For Managers, Contractors, Crew**:
- Active Services tab shows all ongoing services
- Can view service details, start work, verify completion

**For Customers, Centers**:
- My Services tab shows their requested services
- Can track service status and progress

---

## Code Changes Summary

### Backend
- **File**: `apps/backend/server/domains/orders/store.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Center code resolution with participant fallback
  - Service table insertion on `create-service` action
  - Proper column mapping (`service_name` vs `name`)

- **File**: `packages/policies/src/orderPolicy.ts`
- **Changes**: Extended manager permissions for service creation across multiple order statuses
- **Build**: Ran `pnpm build` in policies package

### Frontend
- **Files Modified**:
  - `apps/frontend/src/hubs/ManagerHub.tsx`
  - `apps/frontend/src/hubs/ContractorHub.tsx`
  - `apps/frontend/src/hubs/CrewHub.tsx`
  - `apps/frontend/src/hubs/CustomerHub.tsx`
  - `apps/frontend/src/hubs/CenterHub.tsx`

- **Changes**: Updated `activeServicesData` and `serviceHistoryData` filters in all hubs

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. **Test the complete flow**:
   - Create service order as customer
   - Approve through chain (customer ‚Üí contractor ‚Üí manager)
   - Manager adds crew
   - Crew accepts
   - Manager creates service
   - Verify service appears in Active Services for all users

2. **Add success toast notifications**:
   - "Service created successfully" after create-service
   - Better user feedback for crew assignment

### Short-term
1. **Service Lifecycle Actions**:
   - `start-service`: Mark service as in-progress
   - `complete-service`: Mark service as completed (moves to history)
   - `verify-service`: Manager verification step

2. **Service Details Enhancement**:
   - Show assigned crew on service cards
   - Display service dates/times
   - Show service metadata (type, notes, etc.)

3. **Order Archive Enhancement**:
   - Show transformed service ID on archived orders
   - Link from archived order to active service

### Medium-term
1. **Service Analytics**:
   - Track service completion rates
   - Show service duration/timeline
   - Display crew performance metrics

2. **Notifications**:
   - Notify crew when assigned to service
   - Alert manager when crew responds
   - Notify all participants when service created

---

## Current Roadblocks

### ‚úÖ RESOLVED
1. ~~Service creation failing~~ - Fixed center code resolution
2. ~~Services not appearing in Active Services~~ - Fixed visibility filters
3. ~~Manager can't create service after adding crew~~ - Extended policy permissions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Issues
1. **No success toast** - Service creates successfully but no visual confirmation
2. **Services table schema** - Missing relationship columns (center_id, customer_id, etc.)
   - Current workaround: Join with orders table via service_id/transformed_id
   - Future: Add relationship columns to services table for faster queries

### üîç To Investigate
1. **Service completion flow** - Need to define how/when services move from Active ‚Üí History
2. **Multi-crew assignment** - Currently only first accepted crew is assigned to `crew_id` field
3. **Service actions** - Need UI for start/complete/verify service actions

## Where We Are in the Build Towards MVP

### ‚úÖ Completed (Order System)
- [x] Product order flow (warehouse fulfillment)
- [x] Service order approval chain
- [x] Policy-based permissions system
- [x] Order visibility by role
- [x] Crew assignment workflow
- [x] Service creation from approved orders
- [x] Service visibility across all hubs

### üöß In Progress
- [ ] Service lifecycle management (start/complete/verify)
- [ ] Service-to-order linking in UI
- [ ] Success notifications/toasts

### üìã Remaining for MVP
- [ ] Service completion workflow
- [ ] Service analytics/reporting
- [ ] Bulk operations (assign multiple crew, etc.)
- [ ] Advanced filters (by status, date range, etc.)
- [ ] Export functionality (orders/services to CSV/PDF)

### Progress: ~85% Complete for Orders/Services MVP
**What's Working**:
- Complete order approval flows ‚úÖ
- Role-based visibility ‚úÖ
- Crew assignment ‚úÖ
- Service creation ‚úÖ
- Cross-hub service visibility ‚úÖ

**What's Left**:
- Service lifecycle actions (15%)
- Polish & UX improvements (notifications, loading states, etc.)

---

## Database State

### Services Table
- Currently has 1 test service: `CEN-010-SRV-001`
- Status: `active`
- Created from service order flow

### Orders Table
- Service orders transition through statuses correctly
- `transformed_id` field populated on service creation
- Participants tracked in `order_participants` table

---

## Testing Notes

### Manual Testing Required
1. **Full E2E Flow**:
   ```
   Customer creates order ‚Üí
   Contractor approves ‚Üí
   Manager approves ‚Üí
   Manager adds crew ‚Üí
   Crew accepts ‚Üí
   Manager creates service ‚Üí
   Verify service in Active Services
   ```

2. **Cross-Hub Visibility**:
   - Log in as each user type
   - Verify service appears in correct tab
   - Verify correct actions available

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Multiple crew assignment
   - Service creation with no center (should fail with clear error)
   - Service creation at different order statuses

---

## Configuration/Environment
- Backend running on port 4000
- Policies package rebuilt
- No database migrations required (using existing tables)
- Frontend needs refresh to pick up changes

---

## Notes for Next Session
- Consider adding database migration to add relationship columns to services table
- May want to add `completed_at` timestamp to services table
- Consider adding service status transitions (active ‚Üí in_progress ‚Üí completed)
- Review if we need separate `service_actions` endpoint vs reusing order actions
