# Session Log — CODEX — 2025-10-11

## Summary
- Fixed incorrect “Managed By” display and permissions for warehouse‑managed service reports.
- Unblocked warehouse users from resolving service reports that are warehouse‑managed (managed_by stores a WHS-* ID).
- Added a small DB utility script to quickly inspect a report and the related service’s `managed_by`.

## Changes Since Last Commit
- Backend
  - apps/backend/server/domains/reports/routes.fastify.ts: Updated POST `/reports/:id/resolve` permission logic to:
    - Read `report_category` and `related_entity_id`.
    - Look up `services.managed_by` for service reports and treat values of `warehouse` or any `WHS-*` as warehouse‑managed.
    - Enforce: warehouse resolves order and warehouse‑managed service reports; manager resolves manager‑managed services and procedures.
  - apps/backend/server/domains/reports/repository.ts: Adjusted stakeholder inclusion logic in both update and acknowledge flows to treat `WHS-*` as warehouse‑managed when deciding whether to include warehouse.
  - apps/backend/scripts/check-specific-report.js: New diagnostic script to print a report and its related service’s `managed_by`.

- Frontend (domain-widgets)
  - packages/domain-widgets/src/reports/ReportDetailsModal.tsx: Show “Managed By: Warehouse” when `serviceManagedBy` equals `warehouse` or starts with `WHS-`.
  - packages/domain-widgets/src/reports/ReportCard.tsx: Resolution permission now uses the same `isWarehouseManaged` check (warehouse can resolve warehouse‑managed services).

## New Features
- Role-aware service management detection that recognizes real warehouse IDs (e.g., `WHS-004`) in addition to the literal `warehouse` string.
- Defensive backend enforcement of resolve permissions for service reports based on `services.managed_by`.

## Brief Summary of Code Changes
- Introduced a shared check pattern: values are considered warehouse‑managed if they are exactly `warehouse` (legacy) or begin with `WHS-` (actual warehouse IDs).
- Applied the pattern in frontend display, frontend resolve permissions, and backend stakeholder/resolve authorization.

## Next Steps
- Verify resolve flow end‑to‑end as a warehouse on a known warehouse‑managed service report (e.g., `CON-010-RPT-006`).
- Restart the backend where you observed the 500 on `/api/reports/entities/services`; the current repo code does not query `services.cks_manager`.
- If the 500 persists, capture the exact stack trace; I will trace any other codepaths still referencing `cks_manager`.
- Optional: Centralize `isWarehouseManaged()` in a small shared util to avoid duplication between frontend/backend.

## Current Roadblocks
- TypeScript typing in `ReportCard.tsx` shows pre‑existing Button `onClick` signature mismatches (expects `() => void`, handlers pass an event). Build proceeded but flagged TS2322/TS7006 in domain‑widgets; not introduced by today’s changes.

## MVP Status
- Structured Reports/Feedback feature set is ~95% complete. Today’s fixes close a critical permissions gap and align UI with real `managed_by` values. Pending: final E2E validation, minor typing cleanups, and procedure integration (post‑MVP).

## Additional Notes
- For CON-010-RPT-005 and CON-010-RPT-006, `related_entity_id = CEN-010-SRV-002` and `services.managed_by = WHS-004`, confirming the warehouse‑managed path.
