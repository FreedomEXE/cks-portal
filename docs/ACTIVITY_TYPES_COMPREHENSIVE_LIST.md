# Comprehensive Activity Types List - Admin View

## Overview
This document lists ALL activity types that Admin can see in Recent Activity feed, with UX specifications for each.

**Key Principles:**
- Keep code generic/flexible for future action types
- User stays in Recent Activity section (no tab navigation)
- Modals open contextually based on activity type and state
- DeletedBanner shows for hard-deleted items

## Implementation Notes

### Generic Modal System

Instead of hardcoding specific activity types, use pattern matching:

```typescript
// Pattern-based routing
if (activityType.includes('_created')) {
  // Open entity in view mode
  openEntityModal(targetType, targetId, 'view');
}

if (activityType.includes('_archived')) {
  // Open actions modal (View/Edit/Restore/Delete)
  openActionsModal(targetType, targetId, 'archived');
}

if (activityType.includes('_hard_deleted')) {
  // Open read-only modal with DeletedBanner
  openEntityModal(targetType, targetId, 'deleted');
}

if (activityType.includes('_assigned')) {
  // Open relationship view
  openRelationshipModal(targetType, targetId, metadata);
}
```

### Future-Proofing

New activity types will automatically work with pattern matching:
- `order_modified` ‚Üí Opens order modal
- `service_activated` ‚Üí Opens service modal
- `warehouse_inventory_updated` ‚Üí Opens warehouse modal
- `crew_training_completed` ‚Üí Opens crew modal

### State Detection

Activity system should fetch entity state on click:
1. Click activity ‚Üí Fetch entity with `includeDeleted=1`
2. Check entity state: `active` | `archived` | `deleted`
3. Open appropriate modal with correct props
4. Show DeletedBanner if `state === 'deleted'`

## Questions for Implementation

1. **Service Orders**: Do service orders need different modal than product orders?
2. **Assignment Details**: Should assignments open the assignee or the assigned entity?
3. **Report/Feedback**: Are these implemented yet? Need modal designs?
4. **Inventory Updates**: Should warehouse inventory changes create activities?
5. **Profile Updates**: Should entity profile updates create activities (e.g., "Manager MGR-001 updated profile")?

**Total Activity Types**: 43 (and growing)

**Pattern Categories**: 6
- Creation (`_created`)
- State Change (`_delivered`, `_accepted`, `_rejected`, `_cancelled`)
- Archival (`_archived`)
- Deletion (`_hard_deleted`)
- Restoration (`_restored`)
- Assignment (`_assigned`)
