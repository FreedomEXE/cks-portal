## Testing Progress Summary (Oct 10, 2025)

### ‚úÖ TESTED & WORKING (3 Flows):

1. **Product Order Report** (Warehouse-managed)
   - Report ID: `CEN-010-RPT-012`
   - Creator: Center (CEN-010)
   - Reason: Billing Issue
   - Status: ‚úÖ PASS - Auto-close works correctly

2. **Service Report** (Manager-managed)
   - Report ID: `CUS-015-RPT-011`
   - Creator: Customer (CUS-015)
   - Reason: Crew Behavior
   - Status: ‚úÖ PASS - Stakeholder filtering working

3. **Service Feedback** (Manager creates)
   - Feedback ID: `MGR-012-FBK-001`
   - Creator: Manager (MGR-012)
   - Reason: Excellent Quality (5‚òÖ)
   - Status: ‚úÖ PASS - Modal terminology fixed

### üîß CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED:

1. **Auto-Close Logic Fix** (repository.ts:411-420, 278-287)
   - Now filters `ackCount` to only count stakeholder acknowledgments
   - Non-stakeholders can acknowledge but don't trigger auto-close

2. **Modal Terminology Fix** (ReportDetailsModal.tsx:165, 282, 303, 344)
   - Feedback modals now show "Feedback" labels (not "Report")
   - Resolution section hidden for feedback

3. **Warehouse-Managed Service Detection (Oct 11, 2025)**
   - Services are considered warehouse‚Äëmanaged when `services.managed_by` is:
     - the literal string `warehouse` (legacy), or
     - a specific warehouse ID starting with `WHS-` (e.g., `WHS-004`).
   - Verify ‚ÄúManaged By‚Äù shows Warehouse in ReportDetailsModal for such services.
   - Verify warehouse users can resolve service reports managed by `WHS-*`.

### ‚ùå STILL TO TEST:
- [ ] Order Feedback (Customer/Center/Contractor)
- [ ] Service Feedback (Customer/Center/Contractor - non-Manager)
- [ ] Procedure Reports/Feedback (Not ready yet - skip)
- [ ] Warehouse permissions (cannot create reports)
- [ ] Crew permissions (cannot create anything)
- [ ] Service report resolution as Warehouse on a `WHS-*` managed service
