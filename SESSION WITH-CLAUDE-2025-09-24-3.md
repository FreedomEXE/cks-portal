### 4. Build Process

- Command used: `pnpm build` in packages/domain-widgets directory

## Technical Details

### Files Modified:
1. `apps/frontend/src/hubs/AdminHub.tsx`
2. `apps/frontend/src/hubs/ManagerHub.tsx`
3. `apps/frontend/src/hubs/ContractorHub.tsx`
4. `apps/frontend/src/hubs/CustomerHub.tsx`
5. `apps/frontend/src/hubs/CenterHub.tsx`
6. `apps/frontend/src/hubs/CrewHub.tsx`
7. `apps/frontend/src/hubs/WarehouseHub.tsx`
8. `apps/frontend/src/hubs/components/AdminAssignSection.tsx`
9. `packages/domain-widgets/src/admin/ArchiveSection.tsx`
10. `packages/domain-widgets/src/activity/RecentActivity/RecentActivity.tsx` (reverted unintended change)

### Color System Implementation
All entity types now have consistent color coding across the entire application:
- Each hub's overview cards reflect the appropriate entity colors
- Navigation tabs use the correct color for active states
- Archive section matches the main hub colors
- All references to incorrect colors have been systematically updated

## Notes for Future Development

1. **Color Consistency**: A centralized color configuration file has been documented in `docs/CKS COLOR CODES.md` for reference
2. **New Tab Navigation**: The impersonation feature now supports opening multiple user hubs simultaneously
3. **Build Requirements**: Changes to domain-widgets package require rebuilding with `pnpm build`

## Testing Recommendations

1. Verify all hub overview cards display correct colors
2. Test new tab functionality for user ID clicks in Admin Hub
3. Check Archive section tab colors match main directory
4. Confirm Crew Hub shows correct metrics (Active Services, Completed Tasks, Hours, Status)
5. Validate all navigation tab active states use appropriate colors

## End of Session

All requested color standardization has been completed. The application now has consistent, meaningful color coding that helps users quickly identify different entity types throughout the interface.
