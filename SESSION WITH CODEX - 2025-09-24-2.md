# Session Summary - Codex (2025-09-24-2)

## Changes Since Last Commit
- Updated impersonation utilities to record the active code under both legacy and new session keys so fetchers can always resolve the impersonated user (auth/src/utils/impersonation.ts).
- Adjusted the shared API client to hydrate the impersonation header from the snapshot/session fallback, preventing hub requests from failing during impersonation (apps/frontend/src/shared/api/client.ts).
- Corrected manager dashboard SQL to target the real cks_manager column, fixing metrics lookups for manager personas (apps/backend/server/domains/dashboard/store.ts).
- Reworked the Warehouse hub layout to expose Inventory, Services, and Deliveries using the warehouse-specific data tables instead of the previous ecosystem placeholder (apps/frontend/src/hubs/WarehouseHub.tsx).

## New Functionality
- Hub API requests now impersonate reliably, allowing dashboards, profiles, and orders to return live data for the persona being viewed.
- Warehouse hub surfaces inventory, delivery, and service datasets aligned with backend responses (once data is populated).

## Code Highlights
- readImpersonation tolerates historic session storage keys and keeps storage tidy when clearing impersonation state.
- apiFetch centralises impersonation header injection with safe fallbacks and guardrails.
- Manager dashboard queries leverage existing cks_manager relationships, matching the provisioning schema for managed entities.
- Warehouse hub renders inventory via useHubInventory and separates deliveries/services into dedicated TabSections for clarity.

## Outstanding / Next Steps
- Populate manager/contractor/customer rows in the database to exercise the corrected dashboard queries end-to-end.
- Seed warehouse inventory and delivery records (or wire the backend inventory domain) so the new tabs render live tables.
- Add impersonation-focused integration tests to ensure each hub endpoint responds successfully for its persona.

## Verification
- Pending: rerun role-focused hub smoke tests after seeding data to confirm the "Unable to load dashboard metrics" banner no longer appears.
