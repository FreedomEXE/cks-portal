# Session Summary - 2025-09-26 (Evening)

## Changes Since Last Commit
- Added a shared Clerk client wrapper so backend services can call the management API using CLERK_SECRET_KEY.
- Updated manager provisioning to create the associated Clerk user, persist the returned Clerk ID, and roll back if the remote call fails.
- Synced the manager DTO on the frontend to include the new clerkUserId field returned by the backend.

## New / Adjusted Behaviour
- Creating a manager through the admin hub now also provisions the Clerk user with matching username (lowercased CKS code), email/phone, and metadata, then links the Clerk user ID back into the managers table.
- Provisioning aborts cleanly (and removes the partial row) if Clerk creation fails, avoiding orphaned CKS records.

## Code Touchpoints
- pps/backend/server/core/clerk/client.ts: new helper that instantiates clerkClient from @clerk/backend.
- pps/backend/server/domains/provisioning/store.ts: manager create flow now calls Clerk, updates clerk_user_id, and enriches activity metadata/return payload.
- pps/frontend/src/shared/api/provisioning.ts: Manager record interface now exposes clerkUserId for UI consumers.

## Notes / Follow-up
- Run backend lint/tests (pnpm --filter ./apps/backend lint or equivalent) to validate the new Clerk integration.
- Next steps: extend the same Clerk provisioning/linking pattern to other entity types once this flow is verified with the admin hub UI.
