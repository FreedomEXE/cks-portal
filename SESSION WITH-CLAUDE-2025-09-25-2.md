# Session with Claude - September 25, 2025 (#2)

## Session Overview
**Date**: September 25, 2025
**Agent**: Claude
**Focus Areas**: Warehouse Hub Inventory, Reports, Profile Management, Ecosystem Functionality

---

## Changes Made Since Last Commit (d83e1b3)

### 1. Fixed Warehouse Hub Inventory Loading Issue
**Problem**: Warehouse hub was showing "Unable to load inventory data" error (500 Internal Server Error)

**Root Cause**:
- The inventory API endpoint `/api/hub/inventory/:cksCode` was not implemented
- Database column name mismatch (`name` vs `product_name`)

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created complete inventory domain implementation in backend:
  - `apps/backend/server/domains/inventory/types.ts` - Added inventory type definitions
  - `apps/backend/server/domains/inventory/store.ts` - Created inventory data access layer
  - `apps/backend/server/domains/inventory/service.ts` - Added service layer
  - `apps/backend/server/domains/inventory/routes.fastify.ts` - Implemented API routes
- Registered inventory routes in `apps/backend/server/index.ts`
- Fixed SQL queries to use correct column names (`product_name` instead of `name`)

### 2. Fixed Warehouse Reports Error
**Problem**: Reports endpoint was failing with "column warehouse_id does not exist" error

**Solution**:
- Updated `apps/backend/server/domains/reports/store.ts`
- Modified `getWarehouseReports` function to return empty arrays temporarily
- Added detailed TODO comments explaining future implementation per CKS Reports Workflow documentation

### 3. Removed Account Manager Section from Warehouse Hub
**Change**: Warehouse role no longer shows Account Manager tab in profile

**Files Modified**:
- `packages/domain-widgets/src/profile/ProfileInfoCard/ProfileInfoCard.tsx`
  - Updated logic to exclude Account Manager tab for both Manager and Warehouse roles
  - Modified comments to reflect this change

### 4. Fixed Center Hub Account Manager Display
**Problem**: Center hub was showing customer ID (CUS-013) instead of manager information

**Solution**:
- `apps/frontend/src/hubs/CenterHub.tsx`
  - Changed from `customerCard` to `accountManagerCard`
  - Now correctly pulls manager data from `profile.manager`
  - Displays proper manager name, ID, email, and phone

### 5. Fixed Crew Hub Missing Account Manager
**Problem**: Crew members showed "no manager assigned" despite having proper center assignments

**Solution**:
- `apps/frontend/src/hubs/CrewHub.tsx`
  - Added `accountManagerCard` calculation
  - Added `accountManager` prop to ProfileInfoCard
  - Now properly displays manager information from assigned center

### 6. Updated Claude Configuration
**Changes to `.claude/config.json`**:
- Added server restart warning: "NEVER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE RESTART THE DEV SERVERS OR ANY SERVERS"
- Added database note: "For database queries or migrations, provide SQL scripts for the user to run in Beekeeper Studio"

### 7. Created Migration Files (Not Run)
- Created `database/migrations/20250925_sample_inventory_data.sql` (sample data - user chose not to use)

---

## Code Changes Summary

### Backend Changes
1. **New Files**:
   - Complete inventory domain implementation (4 new files)
   - Database check script (check-schema.ts - not committed)

2. **Modified Files**:
   - `apps/backend/server/index.ts` - Added inventory route registration
   - `apps/backend/server/domains/reports/store.ts` - Fixed warehouse reports query

### Frontend Changes
1. **Modified Files**:
   - `apps/frontend/src/hubs/CenterHub.tsx` - Fixed account manager display
   - `apps/frontend/src/hubs/CrewHub.tsx` - Added account manager support

### Package Changes
1. **Modified Files**:
   - `packages/domain-widgets/src/profile/ProfileInfoCard/ProfileInfoCard.tsx` - Updated role logic

---

## Features Analysis

### Inventory System
- Now functional for warehouse role
- Queries `products` table with proper column names
- Supports active and archived inventory items
- Calculates low stock status (stock_level < reorder_point)

### Account Manager Display
- **Customer**: Shows their assigned CKS Manager
- **Contractor**: Shows their assigned CKS Manager
- **Center**: Shows their assigned CKS Manager (fixed)
- **Crew**: Shows their center's Manager (fixed)
- **Manager**: No Account Manager tab
- **Warehouse**: No Account Manager tab (updated)

### Ecosystem Understanding
- Discovered that Manager hub builds ecosystem tree entirely on frontend
- Uses directory data (useContractors, useCustomers, useCenters, useCrew)
- Filters based on relationships and builds hierarchy client-side
- Other hubs have empty children arrays (need implementation)

---

## Known Issues / Next Steps

### Ecosystem Implementation Needed
All non-Manager hubs show only themselves in ecosystem with no children. Need to either:
1. Implement frontend tree building (like Manager hub)
2. Create backend ecosystem API endpoints

User preference: Create backend endpoints (cleaner approach)

### Reports Implementation
Warehouse reports currently return empty arrays. Need to:
1. Map product/service orders to warehouses
2. Query reports related to those orders
3. Implement per CKS Reports Workflow documentation

### Database Schema Notes
- Products table uses `product_name` not `name`
- Reports table lacks `warehouse_id` column
- Warehouses table has proper structure

---

## Testing Notes

### Verified Working
- ✅ Warehouse inventory loads without errors
- ✅ Center hub shows correct manager info
- ✅ Crew hub shows manager from center
- ✅ Profile tabs correct for all roles

### To Be Tested
- Inventory data display with actual products in database
- Ecosystem functionality for all roles
- Reports functionality once properly linked

---

## Important Configuration Changes
- Claude now configured to never restart servers
- Database operations should provide SQL scripts for Beekeeper Studio
- All changes preserve existing functionality

---

## Session End State
- Repository ready for commit
- All error messages resolved
- Foundation laid for ecosystem API implementation
- Clean separation of concerns maintained
