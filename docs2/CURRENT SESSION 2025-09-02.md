# CURRENT SESSION 2025-09-02

Focus: Multi-hub template compliance cleanup, hierarchical consolidation, and UI simplification across Customer, Center, and Crew hubs following established patterns from previous sessions.

## Highlights

### **Hub Consolidation & Template Cleanup (Complete)** ✅

**Continuation from Previous Sessions**: Building on Manager, Contractor hub redesigns to achieve consistent template compliance and simplified navigation across all template hubs.

**User Requirements**:
- Complete Customer Hub consolidation (My Centers + My Crew → hierarchical My Centers)
- Center Hub template compliance (remove mock data, contact buttons)
- Crew Hub major restructuring (profile cleanup, reports separation, center simplification)
- Ensure all template hubs show proper empty states with 0 values

**Solution Implemented**: Systematic cleanup and consolidation across 3 remaining template hubs

#### **Customer Hub Consolidation**

**Before vs After**:
- **Before**: 8 tabs with separate "My Centers" and "My Crew" sections
- **After**: 7 tabs with hierarchical "My Centers" containing crew assignments

**Technical Implementation**:
- Updated `CustomerSection` type: removed 'crew' option  
- Consolidated navigation from 8 to 7 tabs
- Implemented hierarchical Centers view with visual guide: **Centers → Crew Assignments**
- Added empty state explaining expected structure when populated via Admin Hub
- Removed redundant Management Tools section per user feedback

#### **Center Hub Template Compliance**

**Issues Identified**:
- Dashboard showing "Facility Status: Good ✓" instead of empty state
- Account Manager profile had contact action buttons (template violation)
- News section using component with potential mock data
- Inconsistent empty state messaging

**Changes Made**:
- **Dashboard**: Changed "Facility Status: Good ✓" → "Not Set --"
- **Profile**: Removed Send Email, Schedule Call, Emergency Contact buttons
- **News**: Replaced `CenterNewsPreview` component with consistent empty state
- **Mail**: Updated to "No mail messages available" for consistency

#### **Crew Hub Major Restructuring**

**Complex Multi-Part Renovation**:

**1. Dashboard Metrics Cleanup**
- Removed "Hourly Rate" metric (user request)
- Removed hardcoded "No activity" trend text
- Updated progress indicators from mock "85%" to "0%" empty states
- Fixed progress bars from filled to empty state styling

**2. Profile Section Reorganization**
- **Personal Info**: Removed duplicate Availability and Preferred Areas fields
- **Work Details**: Added Preferred Areas, removed Pay Rate field
- **Result**: Eliminated redundancy, better field organization

**3. Navigation & Structure Overhaul**
- **Added**: New "Reports" tab after Training (7 total tabs)
- **Updated**: `CrewSection` type to include 'reports'
- **Fixed**: Removed 'supplies' from navigation (wasn't in type definition)

**4. Reports & Feedback Separation**
- **Moved**: Complete Reports & Feedback functionality from My Center to dedicated Reports tab
- **Updated**: `useEffect` hook to load data for Reports section instead of Center
- **Preserved**: All report viewing, feedback browsing, and archive search functionality

**5. My Center Simplification**
- **Removed**: Communication card (redundant with dashboard mailbox)
- **Result**: Clean 5-card layout: Schedule, Tasks, Time Card, Procedures, Center Info

**6. Template Compliance**
- **News/Mail**: Updated to consistent "No news updates available" and "No mail messages available"
- **Progress Indicators**: All show 0% with proper empty styling
- **Metrics**: All dashboard values show proper template states

## Strategic Decisions Made

### **Template Hub Philosophy Enforcement**
**Decision**: Maintain strict template compliance with 0 values and empty states  
**Rationale**: Template hubs must clearly distinguish from active hubs  
**Impact**: Clear user understanding of data flow from Admin Hub  

### **Hierarchical Consolidation Pattern**
**Decision**: Follow Manager/Contractor pattern for Customer Hub consolidation  
**Rationale**: Consistent navigation patterns across all hubs  
**Impact**: Scalable architecture ready for complex relationships  

### **Dedicated Reports Strategy** 
**Decision**: Separate Reports & Feedback from Center into dedicated tab in Crew Hub  
**Rationale**: User requested better organization, avoid section overload  
**Impact**: More focused workflows and better information architecture  

### **Profile Field Organization**
**Decision**: Remove duplicate fields and reorganize by logical groupings  
**Rationale**: Better user experience, eliminate confusion  
**Impact**: Cleaner forms and more intuitive data entry

## Additional Updates — Contractor Profile Alignment (MVP)

To support upcoming profile testing, contractor creation and profile reads were aligned across DB, backend, and Admin UI:

- Admin Create → Contractor
  - Required fields at creation: Company Name, Address, Main Contact, Phone, Email, Website
  - Removed Assigned Manager from creation (assigned later via Admin Assign)
  - Status defaults to active; Contractor ID auto‑generated (CON‑###)

- Backend
  - POST `/api/admin/users` (role=contractor): accepts address, website; `cks_manager` optional
  - GET `/api/admin/contractors`: returns main_contact (via contact_person), address, phone, email, status
  - GET `/api/contractor/profile?code=CON-###`: returns computed `years_with_cks`, `contract_start_date`, and live `num_customers`

- Database
  - Migration `006_contractor_profile_fields.sql`: allow NULL `cks_manager`; add `address`, `website`
  - Canonical `Database/schema.sql` updated accordingly

- Frontend
  - Admin Create form updated to require exactly the six fields above
  - Contractor hub data hook now passes `?code=` from URL/path/session to load computed profile fields

- Documentation
  - Added `docs/project/CONTRACTOR_PROFILE_FIELDS.md` (creation vs derived rules)
  - Updated `docs/CKS-FIELD-MAPPING-DOCUMENTATION.md` with Contractor profile mapping
  - Extended `docs/project/API_SURFACE_V1.md` with Contractor endpoints

Action required: run `node Database/migrations/run.js` before testing contractor creation.

Docs housekeeping
- Older sessions moved to `docs/session-archive/` (only latest remains in `docs/`)
- Added `docs/project/OVERVIEW_AND_HANDOFF.md` and `docs/README.md`
- Hub specs moved to `docs/project/hubs/`

## Additional Updates — Assignments, Directory Actions, Invites, Password Reset

### Assignment & Unassigned Buckets
- Contractor → Manager assignment implemented in Admin → Assign (both simplified and bucket views)
  - Validates and assigns via `POST /api/admin/contractors/:id/assign-manager { manager_id }`
  - Case-insensitive ID matching; removed `updated_at` dependency for legacy tables
  - Removes assigned contractors from Unassigned; Directory shows assigned Manager (no longer “Unassigned”)
- Unassigned buckets: Added per-row Delete controls (Contractors/Customers/Centers/Crew/Warehouses)
  - Backend DELETE endpoints added for each entity under `/api/admin/...`

### Directory Improvements
- Actions column: Invite + Delete for (Managers, Contractors, Customers, Centers, Crew, Warehouses)
  - Invite calls `POST /api/admin/auth/invite { role, code, email }` (Clerk magic-link)
  - Directory row mapping now includes `email` for all entities so Invite can work immediately
- Data schema mapping fixed so columns no longer appear blank; shows “Unassigned” for post-assignment IDs

### Clerk Integration (Invites & Password)
- Backend invite endpoint: `POST /api/admin/auth/invite`
  - Creates Clerk user with `username = code.toLowerCase()` and publicMetadata `{ role, <role_id>: code }`
  - Sends Clerk invitation (magic-link) for first sign-in
  - Returns `501 clerk_not_configured` if CLERK not set up
- Login: “Forgot password?” centered under Submit → links to `/forgot` (new)
- New `/forgot` flow (Clerk email code): enter email/username → code to email → set new password
- New `/account` route renders Clerk `<UserProfile>` for password/email management (used by Settings links)

### Per‑Hub Settings Components
- Added lightweight `Settings.tsx` for each hub under `.../components/Settings.tsx`
  - Includes a “Change Password” link to `/account#security`
  - Meant to be embedded in each hub’s existing Settings view (no Home changes)

### Error UX & Stability
- Admin Create: server error details surfaced in UI (`Create failed: …details…`)
- Role normalization: Accepts `manager|management|mgr` on `POST /api/admin/users`
- Create page crash fix: stabilized `lastCreated` handling and removed dangling references
- Support tab restored after accidental removal

### Files Modified (This tranche)
- Frontend
  - `frontend/src/pages/Hub/Admin/Home.tsx`: Assignments (contractor→manager), Unassigned Delete, Directory Actions (Invite/Delete), schema fixes, error surfaces, role handling
  - `frontend/src/pages/Login.tsx`: centered “Forgot password?”, links to `/forgot`
  - `frontend/src/index.tsx`: added routes `/account` (Clerk UserProfile) and `/forgot`
  - Settings components added:
    - `frontend/src/pages/Hub/Manager/components/Settings.tsx`
    - `frontend/src/pages/Hub/Contractor/components/Settings.tsx`
    - `frontend/src/pages/Hub/Customer/components/Settings.tsx`
    - `frontend/src/pages/Hub/Center/components/Settings.tsx`
    - `frontend/src/pages/Hub/Crew/components/Settings.tsx`
    - `frontend/src/pages/Hub/Warehouse/components/Settings.tsx`
  - `frontend/src/pages/ForgotPassword.tsx`: new two-step reset flow
- Backend
  - `backend/server/hubs/admin/routes.ts`: added `/auth/invite`, `/contractors/:id/assign-manager`, DELETE endpoints, improved error details
  - `backend/server/package.json`: added `@clerk/clerk-sdk-node`

### Configuration Notes
- To enable invites in dev:
  - `cd backend/server && npm install`
  - Set `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` in `backend/server/.env`
  - Restart API: `npm run dev`
- Frontend requires `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (already present if sign-in works)
