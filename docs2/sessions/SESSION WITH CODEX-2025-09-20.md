# Session with Codex — 2025-09-20

## Summary of progress
- Flattened the repo so every workspace package (frontend, backend, packages, Test-Interface, etc.) lives at the root and pnpm workspaces resolve cleanly.
- Restored the Test Interface (login + catalog, Tailwind pipeline, CKS branding) so it mirrors production visuals again.
- Added shared styling via `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css` and re-imported it in both Frontend and Test Interface so cards, activity lists, and buttons render with the intended borders/shadows.
- Reintroduced Tailwind/global font smoothing so typography and components match original designs.
- Wired Clerk into the dev runtime:
  - Frontend reads `VITE_CLERK_*` env vars and proxies `/api` to the backend.
  - Backend verifies Clerk sessions (`/v1/sessions/{token}/verify`) and maps the `freedom_exe` account to the admin role via `CLERK_ADMIN_IDENTIFIERS`.
  - `/api/me/bootstrap` now returns `{ role, code }` so the SPA redirects to `/admin/hub` after sign-in.
- Stabilised authentication UX:
  - Split routing with `<SignedIn>` / `<SignedOut>` to prevent the login form from mounting when a session exists.
  - Added submit guard + Clerk error handling (`session_exists`) and created a shared `useLogout` hook that signs out via Clerk, clears cached data, and routes back to `/login`.
- Cleaned up Vite config (ESM) removing the CJS deprecation warning.
- Added session documentation and scripted `pnpm dev` to run backend + frontend together.

## Current state
- Visiting `http://localhost:5173` redirects to `/login` when signed out and `/admin/hub` once Clerk is authenticated.
- Logging in as `freedom_exe` (email `admin@ckscontracting.ca`) lands on the Admin hub; logout takes you back to the login screen.
- Hub UI (overview cards, recent activity, tab sections, buttons) uses shared styles and looks production-ready visually.
- Backend Fastify server listens on `:4000` with Clerk verification and `/api/me/bootstrap` in place.

## Next steps toward production-ready admin hub
1. **Persist users & roles** – replace the env-based admin list with a real table keyed by `clerk_user_id`, storing CKS ID, role, status, audit timestamps.
2. **Admin user APIs** – implement CRUD/invite endpoints (create, edit, suspend) and update `/api/me/bootstrap` to pull from the new store.
3. **Wire hub tabs to real data** – hook Overview metrics, Directory table, Create/Assign/Archive flows, and Support tab to actual backend services instead of fixture data.
4. **Re-enable the gateway** – put the Fastify gateway back in front so the request path matches production and Clerk cookies flow correctly.
5. **Testing & hardening** – add integration tests for auth bootstrap/logout, verify responsive styling, and log/telemetry hooks for production.
6. **Production rollout prep** – configure production Clerk keys/domains, environment-specific API URLs, deployment scripts, monitoring.
7. **After admin is solid** – extend the same pattern to other roles so the full MVP can be exercised end-to-end.

## Agenda for next working session
- Design the user/role persistence layer and seed the initial admin record.
- Build the admin user management API surface and update `/api/me/bootstrap` to consume it.
- Start wiring Admin hub tabs (Overview + Directory first) to those endpoints.
- Plan the gateway cutover and list remaining tasks to bring contractor/manager/etc. into the same flow once admin is production-ready.
