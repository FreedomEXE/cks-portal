## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### 🏗️ Architecture Patterns Established:
- **Hub Isolation**: Each hub has independent `/components`, `/hooks`, `/utils`
- **Consolidated Approach**: Single `Home.tsx` file (1,139+ lines) with all functionality
- **Session Management**: Hub-prefixed session keys (`crew:session`)
- **Minimalistic Design**: Consistent card-based UI with color-coded borders

### 📊 Data Management:
- **Template System**: Hub templates populated with user-specific data
- **Fallback Strategy**: "Not Set" values for missing fields
- **Mock Data**: Comprehensive demo data for development/testing
- **API Integration**: Ready for backend connection with `useCrewData` hook

---

## 🤝 Codex Integration & Review

### 🔍 Critical Issues Identified by Codex:
1. **API Header Mismatch**: `x-crew-user-id` vs `x-user-id` (FIXED)
2. **Response Shape Mismatch**: Frontend expects `json().tasks` vs backend `{ success, data }` (FIXED)
3. **ID Prefix Inconsistency**: `ctr-001` vs `CEN-XXX` format (FIXED)
4. **Field Mapping**: `name` vs `crew_name` expectations (FIXED)

### ✅ Codex Applied Fixes:
- **Headers**: Dual header approach (`x-user-id` + `x-crew-user-id`)
- **Response Parsing**: Smart fallback for multiple response formats
- **ID Standardization**: Consistent `CEN-001` format throughout
- **Field Normalization**: Mapping layer in `useCrewData` hook

### 📚 Codex Documentation Contributions:
- **`docs/project/API_SURFACE_V1.md`** - Shared API patterns
- **`docs/project/CREW_HUB_SPEC.md`** - Complete Crew hub specification  
- **`docs/project/CREW_QA_CHECKLIST.md`** - MVP validation checklist
- **`docs/project/AGENTS.md`** - Agent onboarding guide (excellent!)
