# Session 2025-09-11 Changes - Hub Layout Standardization

## Summary
Fixed spacing consistency across all role-based hubs by removing duplicate padding that was causing inconsistent spacing between header and content areas.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Hub Dashboard Layout Spacing
**Problem**: Customer, center, crew, and warehouse hubs had extra `padding: 24` on their dashboard containers, causing double padding compared to manager/contractor hubs.

**Solution**: Removed duplicate padding from dashboard components to match manager/contractor hub spacing patterns.

**Files Updated**:
- `REFACTOR/Frontend/src/hub/roles/customer/tabs/Dashboard.tsx` - Removed `padding: 24` from main container and loading state
- `REFACTOR/Frontend/src/hub/roles/center/tabs/Dashboard.tsx` - Removed `padding: 24` from main container and loading state  
- `REFACTOR/Frontend/src/hub/roles/crew/tabs/Dashboard.tsx` - Removed `padding: 24` from main container and loading state
- `REFACTOR/Frontend/src/hub/roles/warehouse/tabs/Dashboard.tsx` - Removed `padding: 24` from main container and loading state

### 2. Standardized Dashboard Headers
**Change**: Updated manager dashboard header from "Manager Dashboard" to "Overview" to match all other hub dashboard headers.

**Files Updated**:
- `REFACTOR/Frontend/src/hub/roles/manager/tabs/Dashboard.tsx` - Changed h2 text from "Manager Dashboard" to "Overview"

## Impact
- All role-based hubs now have consistent spacing between the header box (containing hub title and navigation) and the dashboard content
- Uniform "Overview" header across all hub dashboards for better UX consistency
- Eliminated visual inconsistency that was making some hubs appear to have more spacing than others

## Technical Details
The RoleHub component already provides 24px padding to the content area, so the individual dashboard components were creating double padding by adding their own `padding: 24` styles. By removing this duplicate padding, all hubs now have consistent tight spacing that matches the manager/contractor hub pattern.

## Status
✅ All changes completed and tested
✅ Layout consistency achieved across all role hubs
