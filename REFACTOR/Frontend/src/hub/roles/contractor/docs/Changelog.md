- Difficult to maintain and scale
- Limited customization options

**After (Config-driven):**
- Single, reusable hub architecture
- Role-specific configuration files
- Easy to maintain and extend
- Flexible customization system

### Breaking Changes
- Legacy contractor URLs no longer supported
- Updated API endpoints (old endpoints deprecated)
- New authentication flow required
- Configuration file format changed

### Migration Guide
1. Update bookmark URLs to new format: `/CON-XXX/hub`
2. Re-authenticate to establish new session
3. Review updated features and navigation
4. Update any saved configurations
