## Migration Guide

### From Template System (v0.x)

The Center hub has been completely rewritten from the template-based system to a config-driven architecture. Key migration points:

1. **API Changes**
   - Endpoints now use `/api/center/*` prefix
   - Authentication headers now required
   - Response format standardized

2. **Component Updates**
   - All components now TypeScript-first
   - Props interfaces strictly typed
   - Error boundaries implemented

3. **Data Model Changes**
   - Center IDs now use CEN-XXX format
   - Territory relationships formalized
   - Performance metrics standardized

4. **Authentication Changes**
   - Role validation now required
   - Session management centralized
   - Territory access scoping enforced

---

## Breaking Changes

### v1.0.0 Initial Release
- Complete rewrite from template system
- New API endpoint structure
- Updated authentication requirements
- Changed data model format

---

## Known Issues

### Current Limitations
- Territory map requires external mapping service integration
- Performance metrics calculated client-side (consider server-side aggregation)
- Real-time updates not yet implemented
- Bulk operations limited to 100 items

### Workarounds
- Use mock territory data for development
- Implement client-side caching for performance data
- Manual refresh for real-time data needs
- Batch operations in chunks for bulk updates
