-- Migration: 001_initial_schema.sql
-- Description: Initial database schema from schema.sql
-- This migration is a placeholder since schema.sql contains the complete initial structure

-- This migration is intentionally empty as the initial schema 
-- is already defined in schema.sql and applied during database initialization.
-- Future schema changes should be added as numbered migration files.

SELECT 1; -- No-op to ensure migration runs successfully
