## Summary of Changes Since Last Commit

### 1. Fixed Status Display Issues Across All Entity Types

#### Problem Identified
- Customer status was showing as "Assigned" in the directory even though database showed "Active"
- Warehouse status was showing as "Operational" instead of "Active"
- Status values were being hardcoded in frontend instead of using actual database values

#### Root Causes Found
1. **Frontend Hardcoding**: `AdminHub.tsx` was hardcoding status based on managerId presence instead of using actual status field
2. **Backend Transformation**: Dashboard store wasn't normalizing status values consistently
3. **Missing Validator Fields**: Customer and Center validators were missing status field, causing it to be stripped from API responses
4. **Database Column Issues**: Warehouse table had both `name` and `warehouse_name` columns causing confusion

### 2. Database Schema Standardization

#### Column Name Standardization
- Renamed all entity-specific name columns to just `name`:
  - `company_name` → `name` (contractors)
  - `manager_name` → `name` (managers)
  - `warehouse_name` → `name` (warehouses)
  - And others

#### Status Value Normalization
- Created backend transformation to normalize status values:
  - `assigned` → `active`
  - `operational` → `active`
- Warehouses now default to `active` status on creation (they don't get assigned)

### 3. Manager Inheritance Implementation

#### Database Changes
- Added `cks_manager` column to crew table (was missing)
- Updated assignment functions to cascade manager through entity hierarchy:
  - When contractor gets manager → all its customers inherit
  - When customer gets manager → all its centers inherit
  - When center gets manager → all its crew inherit

#### Backend Updates
- Modified `apps/backend/server/domains/assignments/store.ts`:
  - Assignment functions now cascade `cks_manager` to all children
  - Status automatically updates to `active` when assigned
  - Unassignment functions set status back to `unassigned`

### 4. Account Manager Section Styling

#### UI Consistency Updates
- Updated `packages/domain-widgets/src/profile/AccountManagerTab/AccountManagerTab.tsx`
- Made Account Manager section styling match Profile section:
  - Gradient avatar background
  - Consistent borders and shadows
  - Matching font sizes and weights

### 5. Backend API Fixes

#### Directory Endpoint Validators
- Fixed `apps/backend/server/domains/directory/validators.ts`:
  - Added `status` field to `customerDirectoryEntrySchema`
  - Added `status` field to `centerDirectoryEntrySchema`

#### Directory Types
- Updated `apps/backend/server/domains/directory/types.ts`:
  - Added `status` to `CustomerRow` and `CustomerDirectoryEntry`
  - Added `status` to `CenterRow` and `CenterDirectoryEntry`
  - Changed `company_name` to `name` in CustomerRow

#### Directory Store
- Updated `apps/backend/server/domains/directory/store.ts`:
  - Now selects and maps `status` field for customers
  - Already had status mapping for centers

#### Dashboard Store
- Updated `apps/backend/server/domains/dashboard/store.ts`:
  - Added `normalizeStatus()` function to transform status values
  - All dashboard functions now use normalized status

#### Provisioning Store
- Updated `apps/backend/server/domains/provisioning/store.ts`:
  - Warehouse creation now uses `active` status instead of `operational`
  - Fixed column references from `warehouse_name` to `name`

### 6. Frontend Updates

#### Admin Hub
- Fixed `apps/frontend/src/hubs/AdminHub.tsx`:
  - Removed hardcoded status logic for customers
  - Now uses actual status from backend
  - Updated `renderStatusBadge()` to handle null values properly

#### Customer & Contractor Hubs
- Previously updated to transform 'assigned' to 'Active' in display
- Now backend handles this transformation

### 7. SQL Scripts Created

#### UPDATE-WAREHOUSE-STATUS.sql
```sql
-- Migrates warehouse data and status
-- Copies warehouse_name to name column
-- Drops warehouse_name column
-- Updates status from 'operational' to 'active'
```

#### Other SQL Files
- Various migration scripts for column standardization
- Scripts for fixing status values across entities

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `/apps/backend/server/domains/assignments/store.ts`
- `/apps/backend/server/domains/dashboard/store.ts`
- `/apps/backend/server/domains/directory/store.ts`
- `/apps/backend/server/domains/directory/types.ts`
- `/apps/backend/server/domains/directory/validators.ts`
- `/apps/backend/server/domains/provisioning/store.ts`

### Frontend
- `/apps/frontend/src/hubs/AdminHub.tsx`

### Domain Widgets
- `/packages/domain-widgets/src/profile/AccountManagerTab/AccountManagerTab.tsx`

### SQL Scripts
- `/UPDATE-WAREHOUSE-STATUS.sql`

## Key Improvements

1. **Data Consistency**: Status values now flow consistently from database → backend → frontend
2. **No More Hardcoding**: Removed all hardcoded status transformations from frontend
3. **Manager Inheritance**: Full cascade implementation for manager assignments
4. **UI Consistency**: Account Manager section now matches Profile section styling
5. **Schema Standardization**: All name columns standardized to `name`
6. **Proper Status Handling**: All entity types properly handle and display status

## Testing Recommendations

1. Verify status displays correctly for all entity types in Admin Directory
2. Test manager assignment cascades properly through hierarchy
3. Confirm warehouse status shows as 'active' after running migration
4. Check that Account Manager section displays consistently across all user types
5. Validate that unassignment properly resets status to 'unassigned'

## Notes

- User emphasized need for systemic fixes, not quick patches
- User stressed importance of backend solutions over frontend hardcoding
- All changes designed to be forward-compatible with new entities
- Status normalization happens at backend level for consistency
