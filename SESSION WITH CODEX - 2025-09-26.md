# Session Summary - 2025-09-26

## Changes Since Last Commit
- Removed the custom impersonation pipeline (route, guard override, bootstrap hook) so backend authentication now relies solely on Clerk and optional dev overrides.
- Dropped shared auth/session utilities that stored impersonation state and cleaned up hooks/components that referenced them.
- Simplified frontend routing and admin directory actions; clicking a row now stays inside the admin hub and opens the action modal instead of jumping into a fake persona.
- Narrowed logout cleanup to Clerk-related session keys and noted that Manager remains the only fully wired hub.
- Added `scripts/setup-test-users.sql` to seed Clerk IDs with stable role codes during manual testing.

## New / Adjusted Behaviour
- Dev auth overrides (`window.__cksDevAuth`) still work for non-admin requests when `VITE_CKS_ENABLE_DEV_AUTH` / `CKS_ENABLE_DEV_AUTH` are true.
- Admin hub create/assign flows remain intact; the manager happy path is confirmed end-to-end while other roles await Clerk wiring.

## Code Touchpoints
- `apps/backend/server/core/auth/guards.ts`: removed impersonation header handling, consolidated the guard result into a `GuardAccount`, and kept dev-role overrides for local work.
- `apps/backend/server/index.ts`: deleted `/api/admin/impersonate` bootstrap logic and stopped registering the impersonation routes module.
- `apps/backend/server/domains/identity/routes.fastify.ts`: replaced route docs with a stub export to reflect the removal.
- `apps/frontend/src/App.tsx`: collapsed hub routing to `/hub` and dropped the impersonated route.
- `apps/frontend/src/hubs/AdminHub.tsx`: removed impersonation helpers and Clerk token lookups; directory row clicks now just open the action modal in-place.
- `apps/frontend/src/shared/api/client.ts`: stripped impersonation header injection while keeping dev-auth support.
- `apps/frontend/src/hooks/useLogout.ts`: removed impersonation cleanup and reduced the session/local storage keys.
- `auth/src/hooks/useAuth.ts`, `auth/src/index.ts`: excised impersonation state, exports, and request header mutations so the hook simply reflects the Clerk-backed account.

## Notes / Follow-up
- Clerk's impersonation tooling will be integrated next; the manager flow is the template for future role wiring.
- Recommend running `pnpm lint` (or your standard test suites) before committing.
