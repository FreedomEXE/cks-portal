# Session with Claude - September 24, 2025 (Session 2)

## Session Overview
Implemented comprehensive archive/soft-delete system for the CKS Portal, adding support for all entity types including warehouses, services, and products. Fixed critical issues with archive display and enhanced the directory view for cleaner presentation.

## New Features Added

### 1. Complete Archive System Implementation
- **Soft Delete Functionality**: All entities can now be archived instead of permanently deleted
- **30-Day Grace Period**: Archived entities are scheduled for automatic deletion after 30 days
- **Restore Capability**: Archived entities can be restored to unassigned status
- **Permanent Delete Option**: Manual permanent deletion available with confirmation

### 2. Enhanced Relationship Tracking
- **Comprehensive Relationship Storage**: When archiving, the system now stores:
  - Parent relationships (who the entity reported to)
  - Child relationships (who reported to this entity)
  - Entity names alongside IDs for better readability
- **Relationship Viewing**: View Relationships action shows complete hierarchy information

### 3. Extended Entity Support
- Added archive support for:
  - Warehouses
  - Services
  - Products
- Previously only supported: Managers, Contractors, Customers, Centers, Crew

### 4. Archive Section UI
- **Custom Modal**: Replaced generic ActionModal with archive-specific modal showing:
  - Restore to Unassigned button
  - View Relationships button
  - Permanently Delete button
- **Multi-tab Interface**: Separate tabs for each entity type with color coding
- **Search and Filter**: Search within archived entities
- **Manual Refresh**: Added refresh button for real-time updates

### 5. Simplified Directory Display
- Streamlined column display across all entity types
- Consistent format: ID, NAME, EMAIL, PHONE, STATUS, CREATED, ACTIONS
- Removed cluttered fields while preserving all functionality

## Code Changes Summary

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Database Migrations
- **File**: `database/migrations/20250924_add_archive_columns.sql`
  - Added archive columns to all user tables
  - Created `archive_relationships` table
  - Created `archived_entities` view

- **File**: `database/migrations/20250924_add_archive_columns_new_tables.sql`
  - Extended archive columns to warehouses, services, products

#### 2. Archive Store (`apps/backend/server/domains/archive/store.ts`)
- Implemented `archiveEntity()` function with relationship storage
- Implemented `restoreEntity()` function
- Added `listArchivedEntities()` with support for all entity types
- Enhanced `storeRelationships()` to capture complete hierarchy
- Added `hardDeleteEntity()` with safety checks
- Implemented `unassignChildren()` for cascade unassignment

#### 3. Archive Routes (`apps/backend/server/domains/archive/routes.fastify.ts`)
- Added endpoints:
  - `POST /api/archive/delete` - Soft delete
  - `POST /api/archive/restore` - Restore entity
  - `GET /api/archive/list` - List archived entities
  - `DELETE /api/archive/hard-delete` - Permanent delete
- Updated Zod validation to accept all 8 entity types

#### 4. Directory Store Updates (`apps/backend/server/domains/directory/store.ts`)
- Added `WHERE archived_at IS NULL` filters to all queries
- Prevents archived entities from appearing in directory

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Archive API Client (`apps/frontend/src/shared/api/archive.ts`)
- Created comprehensive API client with methods:
  - `listArchived()`
  - `archiveEntity()`
  - `restoreEntity()`
  - `getRelationships()`
  - `hardDelete()`
- Proper TypeScript interfaces for all operations

#### 2. AdminHub Updates (`apps/frontend/src/hubs/AdminHub.tsx`)
- Integrated archive functionality into delete flow
- Added SWR cache invalidation instead of page refresh
- Extended delete handling for all 8 entity types
- Simplified directory column configurations
- Fixed impersonation prevention on View button

#### 3. ArchiveSection Component (`packages/domain-widgets/src/admin/ArchiveSection.tsx`)
- Complete archive management interface
- Custom modal for archive-specific actions
- Support for all 8 entity types with tabs
- Enhanced relationship display
- Real-time data refresh capabilities

## Bug Fixes

1. **Fixed Import Errors**: Resolved "default export" error in archive.ts
2. **View Button Impersonation**: Added `e.stopPropagation()` to prevent unwanted impersonation
3. **Missing Database Columns**: Added migration scripts for archive columns
4. **SWR Cache Keys**: Fixed cache invalidation paths from `/api/` to `/admin/`
5. **Entity Type Validation**: Extended Zod schemas to accept new entity types
6. **ID Field Handling**: Fixed warehouse/service/product deletion using correct ID field

## Database Schema Changes

### New Columns Added to All Entity Tables:
- `archived_at` TIMESTAMP
- `archived_by` VARCHAR(50)
- `archive_reason` TEXT
- `deletion_scheduled` TIMESTAMP
- `restored_at` TIMESTAMP
- `restored_by` VARCHAR(50)

### New Table: `archive_relationships`
```sql
CREATE TABLE archive_relationships (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  entity_type VARCHAR(50),
  entity_id VARCHAR(50),
  parent_type VARCHAR(50),
  parent_id VARCHAR(50),
  relationship_data JSONB,
  archived_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  archived_by VARCHAR(50),
  restored BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);
```

## Important Notes

### Sequence Management
- IDs are never reused after deletion (PostgreSQL sequences only increment)
- This is intentional for data integrity and audit trail purposes
- Example: Deleting MGR-001 means next manager will be MGR-002+

### Testing Considerations
- Created delete scripts for testing (not for production use)
- Database connection issues with Node.js scripts on Windows
- Recommended using database clients like Beekeeper for manual operations

### Future Enhancements Possible
- Automated cleanup cron job for scheduled deletions
- Bulk archive/restore operations
- Archive audit trail visualization
- Relationship restoration suggestions
